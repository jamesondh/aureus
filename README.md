# Aureus

A generative storytelling project that produces a serialized, ~30-minute episode drama set in the late Roman Republic. The creative goal is "a soap engine wearing a thriller suit": interpersonal volatility (secrets, loyalty shifts, betrayals, status games) drives character motivation and consequences, while the surface plot feels like a financial/political thriller (courts, elections, grain markets, patronage, rumor warfare).
