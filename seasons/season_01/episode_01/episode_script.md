## SC01 — EXT. THE ROMAN FORUM - DAWN

---NARRATOR---
(Ominous) [Stability: 0.7]
Mist clings to the flagstones like a shroud. The temples emerge from grey half-light, their marble columns stained amber where the first sun touches them. A street sweeper—old, bent, forgotten—drags his broom between the shuttered stalls of money-changers. The scrape of bristles against stone is the only sound. The Forum lies empty. Waiting.
---END NARRATOR---

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Quintus Fabius Maximus enters from the direction of the Palatine, his toga praetexta immaculate, its purple stripe sharp against the white. He walks alone—no clients trail behind him, no slaves carry his documents. This absence speaks louder than any retinue. He stops before the Rostra, that ancient platform where his father once thundered against Carthage.
---END NARRATOR---

QUINTUS: (Contemplative, Measured) [Stability: 0.7] "Moribus antiquis res stat Romana virisque."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] The Ennius quotation hangs in the morning air—'On ancient customs and men stands the Roman state.'

QUINTUS: (Bitter, Controlled) [Stability: 0.6] "The ancestors built this Forum stone by stone. With hands that knew labor. With purses that knew restraint."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He turns slowly, surveying the gilded facades of the new basilicas, the imported marble, the ostentation that has crept into every corner.

QUINTUS: (Rising Anger, Still Measured) [Stability: 0.5] "Now we build with borrowed gold and broken oaths."

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
A young clerk hurries past, ledgers clutched to his chest, heading toward the banking quarter. He does not meet the senator's eyes. No one meets them anymore. Quintus watches him go. His jaw tightens. He reaches into his toga and withdraws a small clay tablet—a debt marker, covered in figures. He does not look at it directly, as a man might avoid looking at a wound.
---END NARRATOR---

QUINTUS: (Quiet, Defensive) [Stability: 0.6] "Drusilla says I must learn to bend. That the old ways buy nothing but empty rooms and silent clients."

QUINTUS: (Hardening, Resolved) [Stability: 0.7] "Let them have their gold, then. Let Varo count his coins until his fingers bleed. The ancestors watch. The ancestors judge."

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
The sun breaks fully over the eastern temples. Light floods the Forum, and with it comes the sound of the city waking—footsteps, cart wheels, the first calls of vendors. Quintus turns toward the Curia. His walk is steady, his back straight. But the clay tablet remains in his hand, unread, undestroyed.
---END NARRATOR---

FRUIT VENDOR: (Low, To Herself) [Stability: 0.8] "Dead men walking look just like that."

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] The Forum fills with light and noise. The day begins. But somewhere in the banking quarter, ledgers are already open, and debts are being tallied.

## SC02 — INT. VARO'S STUDY - MORNING

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Incense smoke curls through slanted light. The room reeks of sandalwood and ambition—cedar tables heaped with scrolls, a bronze astrolabe catching the sun, maps of Mediterranean shipping lanes pinned to every wall. Two exhausted messengers slump against the doorframe, their cloaks still damp with harbor spray. Varo stands at the central table, his short tunic already tugged loose at the collar. He traces a finger along the African coast, then checks the sun's position through the window.
---END NARRATOR---

CAELUS VARO: (Impatient, Clipped) [Stability: 0.7] "The Alexandrian convoy. How many days delayed?"

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Nervous, Precise) [Stability: 0.4] "Seven, Patron. Storm damage off Crete. Three ships taking water, two more turned back entirely."

CAELUS VARO: (Calculating, Staccato) [Stability: 0.8] "Seven days. The Subura doesn't know. The Senate doesn't know. The grain factors in Ostia are still quoting yesterday's prices."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He tugs at his tunic again, a predator's grin spreading across his face.

CAELUS VARO: (Profane, Triumphant) [Stability: 0.7] "By Jupiter's swollen cock, we buy everything. Every future contract. Every warehouse option south of the Palatine."

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Deferential, Uneasy) [Stability: 0.3] "Patron, the quantities you're describing—when the price spikes, families will go hungry. Children will—"

CAELUS VARO: (Sharp, Interrupting) [Stability: 0.6] "Children. Spare me. Rome is always hungry for something. Today it's grain. Tomorrow it's games. The mob's belly is not my burden."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He shoves a fresh tablet toward Marcus, who catches it with fumbling hands.

CAELUS VARO: (Mathematical, Cold) [Stability: 0.8] "Forty thousand modii through Decimus at the Emporium. Another thirty through that Phoenician—what's his name—"

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Quick, Calculating) [Stability: 0.5] "Hanno. He operates from the third warehouse past the Temple of Portunus."

CAELUS VARO: (Satisfied, Dismissive) [Stability: 0.7] "Hanno. Done. Execute before the third watch. I want our position locked before the first rumor crawls up from the docks."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus scratches figures onto the tablet—his hands steady now, falling into the mathematics of corruption. He knows these numbers. He has always known them.

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Resigned, Precise) [Stability: 0.5] "At projected scarcity prices... the margin approaches two hundred thousand sesterces."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Varo checks the sun again. He adjusts a weight on his bronze scale—the gesture almost tender.

CAELUS VARO: (Quiet, Dangerous) [Stability: 0.8] "Information arriving before the markets open is worth more than a province, Marcus. Remember that."

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Fearful, Low) [Stability: 0.3] "And if someone investigates? The records will show—"

CAELUS VARO: (Contemptuous, Final) [Stability: 0.9] "The records show what I pay them to show. Now go. Rome's hunger waits for no man."

---NARRATOR---
(Ominous) [Stability: 0.7]
Marcus exits. Varo returns to his maps, humming softly. Outside, a messenger's horse stamps in the courtyard—carrying news that will starve a city and fill his coffers.
---END NARRATOR---

CAELUS VARO: (Satisfied, Intimate) [Stability: 0.9] "Let Quintus Fabius sniff around the courts all he likes. By the time he smells the rot, he'll already be standing in it."

## SC03 — INT. FABIUS HOUSE - ATRIUM - MORNING

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Sunlight falls through the compluvium in a single bright column, catching the dust motes that drift above the impluvium's still water. The smell of fresh bread from the kitchens mingles with something sharper—burnt herbs, perhaps, from an early morning offering. Quintus Fabius Maximus stands before the household shrine, adjusting the fold of his toga with practiced fingers. The wax masks of his ancestors stare down from their alcoves, their painted eyes following nothing, seeing everything.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Drusilla enters from the peristyle. Her stola is the grey of winter seas, her posture perfect as a temple column. She carries a small wax tablet—sealed.

QUINTUS: (Measured, Formal) [Stability: 0.7] "You rise early, wife. The bread is not yet cool."

DRUSILLA: (Neutral, Low) [Stability: 0.8] "I had letters to attend. The household accounts grow complex."

QUINTUS: (Defensive, Moralizing) [Stability: 0.6] "Accounts. Yes. Ennius wrote that a careful wife is the foundation of the house—but he never imagined a house with so many... correspondences."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He gestures vaguely toward the tablet. Drusilla's fingers close over it, drawing it against her hip.

DRUSILLA: (Clinical, Quiet) [Stability: 0.8] "The grain shipments require coordination. Nothing more."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus steps closer. His hand rises as if to touch the tablet, then falls. He will not look at it directly—as though it were a stack of coins.

QUINTUS: (Uneasy, Halting) [Stability: 0.5] "The Forum speaks of Varo's new contracts. They say he has... connections. Among the old families."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] A pause. Drusilla's face betrays nothing. Her silence fills the atrium like water rising in a basin.

DRUSILLA: (Soft, Diagnostic) [Stability: 0.8] "Men speak of many things in the Forum. Most of it is wind."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] She moves past him toward the tablinum, the sealed tablet still pressed to her side. At the threshold, she pauses.

DRUSILLA: (Precise, Final) [Stability: 0.9] "The ancestors watch, husband. But they cannot read."

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] She is gone before he can answer. Quintus stands alone beneath the open sky, the column of light falling just short of where he stands—leaving him in shadow.

## SC04 — EXT. THE ROMAN FORUM - NOON

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
The sun strikes the marble steps of the Basilica Aemilia without mercy. Heat shimmers rise from the flagstones where advocates gather in tight knots, their voices a constant hum beneath the colonnade's shadow. A lictor stands at the court entrance, his fasces bound with white ribbon—the mark of civil proceedings.
---END NARRATOR---

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Quintus Fabius Maximus emerges from the shade, a sealed document pressed against his chest. His toga gleams white, freshly chalked, the folds arranged with deliberate care. Behind him, a clerk carries the ink and registry.
---END NARRATOR---

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Near the fountain of Marsyas, Marcus Licinius counts bronze coins into a leather pouch. His eyes dart to the gallery where two men in expensive tunics lean against a column—Varo's watchers, present as always.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus adjusts his toga fold and approaches with measured steps.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Resolute, Commanding) [Stability: 0.8] "Marcus Licinius. Keeper of accounts for the house of Caelus Varo."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus's hands freeze mid-count. He wipes them on his tunic, leaving dark smears.

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Wary, Quiet) [Stability: 0.4] "Advocate Fabius. I have no business with you."

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Formal, Deliberate) [Stability: 0.8] "The courts have business with you. By authority of the Praetor Urbanus, you are hereby compelled to testify before the quaestio de repetundis regarding grain contracts held by your patron."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He extends the sealed document. Marcus stares at the official seals—the red wax of the praetor's office, the imprint of crossed wheat sheaves.

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Desperate, Low) [Stability: 0.3] "You do not understand what you ask. The numbers I keep—" *His eyes dart to Varo's men in the gallery.* "There are ledgers that should remain closed."

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Moralizing, Steady) [Stability: 0.7] "As Ennius wrote: 'The good man fears not the light of day.' The ancestors watch, Marcus. They judge every action—yours, mine, and your patron's."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He presses the document into Marcus's trembling hands. The clerk notes the delivery in his registry with a scratch of stylus on wax.

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Fearful, Calculating) [Stability: 0.35] "You have just signed my death warrant. And perhaps your own."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus refuses to look at the bronze coins scattered across Marcus's counting table.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Grim, Certain) [Stability: 0.75] "Profit without labor is a cancer on the Republic. I mean to cut it out."

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] Above them, Varo's agents push away from the column and slip toward the Forum's northern exit. Word will reach the Palatine before the noon sacrifice concludes.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus clutches the subpoena against his chest, eyes following the departing watchers.

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Hollow, Prophetic) [Stability: 0.3] "You think this document protects you. But Varo knows where the bodies are buried, Advocate—because he put them there himself."

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] The lictor's shadow falls across the flagstones as clouds pass before the sun. Somewhere in the Forum, a money-changer drops his scales with a clatter.

## SC05 — INT. PUBLIC BATHS (PRIVATE ALCOVE) - AFTERNOON

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Steam coils through marble columns like conspirators gathering in corners. The tepidarium's heat presses close, thick with the scent of olive oil and sweat. Through the haze, slaves move as shadows, their footsteps swallowed by the wet stone. In a recessed alcove, away from the main pool where senators float like pale corpses, two men sit on a bench worn smooth by a thousand nervous conversations.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Varo tugs at his short tunic, checking the angle of light filtering through the high windows. His eyes fix on Marcus like a moneylender calculating interest.

CAELUS VARO: (Impatient, Clipped) [Stability: 0.7] "Enough pleasantries. The sun moves. I don't."

Marcus wipes his palms on his tunic, leaving dark streaks. His gaze flicks to the archway leading to the main chamber, then back.

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Nervous, Measured) [Stability: 0.4] "Dominus, the records you ask about—they're locked in the basilica vault. Three seals. Two witnesses required for—"

CAELUS VARO: (Cutting, Mathematical) [Stability: 0.7] "I didn't ask how. I asked how much."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] A slave passes with fresh towels. Both men fall silent until the footsteps fade into the steam.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Varo reaches into the folds of his garment and withdraws a leather pouch. The coins within do not clink—they are packed too tightly for that. He sets it on the bench between them. Five talents' weight. A small fortune.

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Calculating, Torn) [Stability: 0.3] "That is... generous. More than generous."

CAELUS VARO: (Soft, Menacing) [Stability: 0.8] "Generosity has a sister. Her name is Expectation."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus's hand hovers over the pouch. Sweat beads at his temple, and not from the heat.

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Anguished, Whispered) [Stability: 0.2] "If the magistrates discover—"

CAELUS VARO: (Profane, Final) [Stability: 0.7] "The magistrates eat from my hand like temple dogs. Take the coin, Marcus. Be loyal. Be silent." He leans closer. "Be remembered fondly."

Marcus's fingers close around the leather. His jaw tightens.

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Defeated, Precise) [Stability: 0.4] "The shipping manifests. The discrepancies in the grain accounts. I will... forget what I've seen."

CAELUS VARO: (Satisfied, Cold) [Stability: 0.8] "Good. Memory is expensive. Forgetfulness—is affordable."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He taps the pouch. Varo stands, checking the sun's position through the steam once more. He adjusts his tunic and moves toward the archway.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus remains seated, clutching the bribe. His eyes find the mosaic floor—Neptune drowning sailors, their faces frozen in terror.

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Hollow, To Himself) [Stability: 0.3] "The courts are just another market."

Varo pauses at the threshold. Does not turn.

CAELUS VARO: (Quiet, Lethal) [Stability: 0.9] "Marcus. Those who betray me—they don't testify at trial. They testify to the river."

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] The steam swallows him whole.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus opens the pouch. Counts. His hands shake as he mouths the sum.

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] In the main pool, a senator laughs at nothing. The sound echoes like judgment.

## SC06 — EXT. THE ROMAN FORUM - AFTERNOON

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
The midday heat presses down upon the flagstones like a creditor's hand. Incense from a nearby shrine mingles with the sharper tang of sweat and coin-dust rising from the Basilica Aemilia. A crowd has gathered—wool-merchants abandoning their stalls, grain-factors pausing mid-negotiation, slaves pressing close enough to catch the words of their betters. All eyes fix upon the steps where Quintus Fabius Maximus stands rigid as a temple column, a scroll bearing the quaestor's seal clutched in his weathered hand.
---END NARRATOR---

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Resolute, Thundering) [Stability: 0.7] "Citizens of Rome! Hear the judgment of the treasury upon one who has made mockery of our grain supply!"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He adjusts his toga fold with deliberate care, refusing to meet the glint of gold denarii scattered near a money-changer's table.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Righteous, Measured) [Stability: 0.7] "As Ennius wrote: 'Moribus antiquis res stat Romana virisque.' By ancient custom and by worthy men does Rome endure. Not by speculation. Not by hoarding whilst the plebs hunger."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] A lictor steps forward, pressing an iron seal against the warehouse manifest. The crowd gasps—a collective intake of breath that echoes off the marble.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Varo pushes through the throng, his short tunic drawing sneers from patrician onlookers. He tugs at the hem, checking the sun's position even as fury twists his features.

CAELUS VARO: (Incredulous, Clipped) [Stability: 0.4] "You seal my warehouses? My grain? On what authority—on what evidence beyond rumor and spite?"

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Cold, Formal) [Stability: 0.8] "On evidence sufficient for the quaestor. Your assets are frozen until investigation concludes. The seals are affixed. It is done."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] A second lictor moves through the crowd, affixing notices to the wooden posts near the grain exchange. Traders begin shouting—first confusion, then alarm. A stout factor named Horatius shoves past a slave, bellowing for his clerks. Prices called across the forum swing wildly: three sesterces, then five, then two.

CAELUS VARO: (Seething, Staccato) [Stability: 0.3] "You fool. You self-righteous, moralizing fool. Do you understand what you have done? One breath from now, every contract in this city becomes worthless paper."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] The crowd's murmur rises to a roar. A grain-carrier drops his basket; wheat spills across the stones. Near the Temple of Castor, a young scribe named Tertius—employed by neither man but caught in the current—scrambles to record the chaos, his stylus flying.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Defensive, Quiet) [Stability: 0.6] "The ancestors watch. Some prices must be paid."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Varo steps close, close enough that only Quintus can hear.

CAELUS VARO: (Venomous, Whispered) [Stability: 0.2] "Then let us speak of prices, Fabius. Ask your wife what she knows of mine."

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] Quintus's hand freezes upon his toga. The crowd surges. Somewhere in the chaos, a man screams that the grain markets are collapsing.

## SC07 — EXT. THE ROMAN FORUM - AFTERNOON

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
The afternoon sun beats down upon the marble flagstones, throwing sharp shadows from the Temple of Saturn's columns across the milling crowd. The smell of heated stone mingles with olive oil from a nearby vendor's cart. Near the Rostra, a cluster of citizens has gathered—wool merchants, a pair of scribes, an elderly freedman leaning on his stick—their conversation dying as two figures approach from opposite ends of the Via Sacra.
---END NARRATOR---

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Quintus Fabius Maximus walks with the measured dignity of a man who has prosecuted in these very courts for three decades. His toga virilis, precisely draped, speaks of the old ways. Behind him, a young clerk carries a bundle of wax tablets.
---END NARRATOR---

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
From the direction of the Basilica Aemilia comes Caelus Varo—shorter, leaner, his tunic cut unfashionably brief above the knee. He tugs at the hem as he walks, eyes flicking toward the sun's position above the rooftops.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Their paths intersect before the Temple of Castor.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Formal, Measured) [Stability: 0.7] "Varo. The gods grant you—"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Varo pivots on his heel. Turns his back. The motion is unhurried, deliberate as a blade drawn from its sheath.

CAELUS VARO: (Cold, Projected toward the crowd) [Stability: 0.8] "Gnaeus. Spurius. I wonder—do they teach Roman commercial law in the provinces these days? Or do they still rely on sheep-counting and the testimony of goatherds?"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] A nervous laugh ripples through the wool merchants. The elderly freedman looks away.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus's hand moves to adjust his toga fold—once, twice. His jaw tightens.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Strained, Fighting for composure) [Stability: 0.5] "You forget yourself, Varo. My family held the praetorship when yours was still—"

CAELUS VARO: (Dismissive, Interrupting) [Stability: 0.8] "Held. Past tense. A breath ago, your grandfather mattered. Now? You prosecute fishmongers for short weights while actual Romans conduct actual business."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He checks the sun again. The crowd's silence thickens. A scribe pretends to examine his stylus. No one meets Quintus's eyes.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Wounded, Barely controlled) [Stability: 0.4] "As Ennius wrote—'Whom the gods would destroy, they first—'"

CAELUS VARO: (Bored, Already walking away) [Stability: 0.9] "Spare me your dead poets, provincial."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Varo's sandals strike the flagstones as he departs toward the Argiletum, not once looking back. The wool merchants drift away. The freedman shuffles toward a water basin.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus stands alone before the temple, the afternoon light harsh upon his face. His clerk hovers, uncertain.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus's voice, when it comes, is barely above a whisper—but in the emptied space, it carries.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Quiet, Cold fury building) [Stability: 0.3] "My wife will hear of this. And she... she knows things about that man's ledgers that would make the Rostra weep."

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] His hand falls from his toga. He does not adjust it again.

## SC08 — INT. THE CROOKED CUP TAVERN - EVENING

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Smoke from cheap tallow candles hangs low beneath warped beams. The tavern reeks of spilled wine and wet wool. In the back corner, behind a curtain of rough-spun linen, Drusilla sits alone at a table scarred by knife marks and old burns. Before her: a map of grain routes, three wax tablets, and a leather pouch heavy with coin.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] She does not look up when MILO, a wiry freedman with ink-stained fingers, slips through the curtain.

MILO: (Nervous, hushed) [Stability: 0.4] "Domina. The word from the Forum—they vote on the asset freeze at dawn."

Drusilla traces a finger along the grain route from Sicilia. Her posture is marble-still.

DRUSILLA: (Clinical, low-volume) [Stability: 0.8] "The Claudian warehouses. The Ostian granaries. Who holds the contracts?"

MILO: (Eager, quick) [Stability: 0.4] "Mostly Fabius interests, Domina. But the secondary shares—those trade freely until the freeze takes hold."

Drusilla opens the leather pouch. Gold aurei catch the dim light. She counts out fifteen coins with the precision of a surgeon.

DRUSILLA: (Measured, diagnostic) [Stability: 0.8] "Buy the secondary shares before the third watch. All of them. Use the Alexandrian name."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Milo's hands tremble as he takes the coins. He hesitates.

MILO: (Worried, pleading) [Stability: 0.3] "If anyone traces this back—"

DRUSILLA: (Cold, absolute) [Stability: 0.9] "They will trace nothing. You will be in Puteoli by morning. I will be in my husband's bed."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] She holds his gaze—unblinking, patient as a viper. Milo swallows hard and vanishes through the curtain.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Drusilla permits herself one slow breath. She rolls the map, stacks the tablets. Her investments will triple when the freeze strikes. Quintus will never know he armed her.

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] The curtain stirs again. She freezes.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] A young man in a senator's toga praetexta stands in the gap—SERVIUS, aide to the Elder Cato. His eyes move from Drusilla's face to the ledgers to the pouch.

SERVIUS: (Calculating, soft) [Stability: 0.6] "The wife of Fabius. In such a... modest establishment."

Drusilla rises. Perfect posture. She meets his gaze with silence—her oldest weapon.

SERVIUS: (Probing, careful) [Stability: 0.6] "Strange hours for a woman of your standing. Strange company, too."

DRUSILLA: (Stoic, dangerously calm) [Stability: 0.8] "I visit where I choose. As do you, it seems."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Servius smiles—the smile of a man cataloguing ammunition.

SERVIUS: (Knowing, quiet) [Stability: 0.7] "The Elder Cato takes great interest in... irregular transactions. Especially before significant votes."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He withdraws. The curtain falls.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Drusilla stands motionless. Her face betrays nothing. But her hand, resting on the table, presses down hard enough to whiten her knuckles.

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] The gold is won. The watcher is loose. And the scales have begun to tip.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] She whispers to the empty air:

DRUSILLA: (Quiet, steel beneath silk) [Stability: 0.7] "One blade drawn invites another."

## SC09 — INT. VARO'S STUDY - EVENING

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Lamplight catches the bronze fittings of Varo's counting table, throwing crooked shadows across scrolls weighted with silver coins. The air tastes of old ink and sandalwood—the scent of calculation. Through narrow windows, the dying sun bleeds copper across Rome's rooftops. Varo stands with his back to the door, tugging at his short tunic, watching the light fail.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] A slave admits Drusilla without announcement. She enters like smoke—silent, contained, her dark stola arranged with geometric precision.

VARO: (Impatient, Clipped) [Stability: 0.5] "You come at dusk. Like a physician to a deathbed."

DRUSILLA: (Clinical, Measured) [Stability: 0.7] "I come when summoned, Varo. You sent word through Philo."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Varo turns. His eyes perform their familiar inventory—her hands, her posture, the distance she keeps from the door.

VARO: (Suspicious, Mathematical) [Stability: 0.5] "I sent word three days past. You arrive now. After your husband's advocate filed against my shipping interests."

DRUSILLA: (Stoic, Low-volume) [Stability: 0.7] "I am not Quintus's keeper. Nor his advocate."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] She does not blink. Varo circles the counting table, fingers trailing across stacked tablets.

VARO: (Profane, Staccato) [Stability: 0.4] "No. You are his wife. Who whispers in my ear while he sharpens his blade for my throat."

DRUSILLA: (Diagnostic, Controlled) [Stability: 0.6] "I came to propose restraint. On both sides. This feud serves neither house."

VARO: (Bitter, Accusatory) [Stability: 0.4] "Restraint. You play the mediator while standing with one foot in each camp. Tell me, Drusilla—when the ground splits, which half swallows you?"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Drusilla's perfect posture does not waver, but her silence stretches a breath too long. Varo sees it. His smile has no warmth.

VARO: (Threatening, Low) [Stability: 0.5] "Information arriving before noon is worth more than a province. Arriving after? It suggests the messenger chose when to deliver. And to whom."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He picks up a stylus, examines its point.

DRUSILLA: (Frustrated, Contained) [Stability: 0.5] "I have kept your confidences for three winters. My loyalty—"

VARO: (Cutting, Sharp) [Stability: 0.4] "Your loyalty is to yourself. As is mine. The difference is I do not pretend otherwise."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He drops the stylus. It clatters against bronze.

VARO: (Cold, Final) [Stability: 0.6] "Return to your husband. Tell him nothing. Tell me nothing. You have made yourself a bridge, Drusilla. Bridges get walked upon. Or burned."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Drusilla inclines her head—the barest acknowledgment. At the threshold, she pauses.

DRUSILLA: (Quiet, Diagnostic) [Stability: 0.7] "Bridges also charge tolls, Varo. Remember that when you need to cross."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] She withdraws into shadow. Varo stares at the empty doorway, then at the failing light.

VARO: (To himself, Calculating) [Stability: 0.5] "The wife or the husband. One must be bought. One must be broken."

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] He reaches for his tablets. The lamplight flickers. Somewhere in the house, a door closes with the finality of a tomb.

## SC10 — EXT. THE ROMAN FORUM - EVENING

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
The dying light bleeds copper across the Temple of Saturn, casting the Forum's marble into shadow. Vendors fold their stalls. A slave sweeps ash from the steps of the Rostra. In the colonnade beside the Basilica Aemilia, where the crowd thins and senators may speak without witnesses, GAIUS CRASSIPES waits with the patience of a man who has brokered a hundred such meetings.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] QUINTUS FABIUS MAXIMUS approaches, his toga praetexta catching the evening wind. He walks as though the ancestors themselves observe his gait.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] CRASSIPES touches Quintus's arm in greeting, his smile immediate and practiced.

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Warm, Collegial) [Stability: 0.7] "Quintus Fabius! How long since we've spoken properly? Your father—may the gods keep his shade—would be proud to see you standing so firm in these... turbulent waters."

Quintus does not return the touch. He adjusts the fold of his toga, eyes fixed on the darkening sky beyond the columns.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Guarded, Formal) [Stability: 0.6] "Crassipes. You did not summon me here to speak of my father."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] A litter passes nearby, borne by four Numidian slaves. Crassipes waits until it rounds the corner before continuing, his voice dropping.

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Smooth, Conspiratorial) [Stability: 0.7] "There are men—reasonable men—who believe the current... unpleasantness need not continue. Certain interests might find satisfaction. Other interests might discover unexpected flexibility."

He laughs softly, as though sharing a jest. His hand finds Quintus's arm again.

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Coaxing, Measured) [Stability: 0.6] "Rome requires balance, Quintus. Not martyrs."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus's jaw tightens. He turns to face Crassipes directly, and where the broker sees negotiation, Quintus offers only stone.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Cold, Declarative) [Stability: 0.8] "Ennius wrote that a man's worth is measured not by what he gains, but by what he refuses to sell. You speak of flexibility—I hear only the sound of chains being forged."

Crassipes's smile falters. He releases Quintus's arm.

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Frustrated, Warning) [Stability: 0.5] "The moderates grow weary, Fabius. There are those who would stand with you—if you would but meet them halfway. Push them aside, and you stand alone."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus does not look at him. His gaze falls upon a bronze coin that has rolled to rest near his sandal—dropped by some careless merchant. He makes no move to retrieve it.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Resolute, Quiet) [Stability: 0.7] "Then I stand alone. But I stand."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He turns and walks into the gathering dusk. Crassipes watches him go, the easy warmth draining from his face.

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Bitter, Under Breath) [Stability: 0.5] "So be it, old friend. But the Senate remembers who could not bend—and who broke instead."

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] The Forum empties. The bronze coin catches the last light of the sun before a slave's broom sweeps it into shadow.

## SC11 — INT. FABIUS HOUSE - ATRIUM - NIGHT

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
A single oil lamp gutters on the household shrine, throwing the bronze lares into dancing shadow. The impluvium lies still as black glass. From somewhere deep in the house, a slave's bare feet whisper across tile—then silence. The kind of silence that settles over a home when its master returns wounded.
---END NARRATOR---

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Quintus Fabius Maximus paces the length of the atrium, his toga half-undone, the purple stripe catching lamplight with each turn. He stops. Adjusts the fold at his shoulder. Resumes pacing. The ancestors watch from their painted alcoves, and he cannot meet their eyes.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] A rustle of linen. Drusilla emerges from the corridor leading to the private chambers, her stola the color of old bone. She does not hurry. She never hurries.

DRUSILLA: (Measured, Clinical) [Stability: 0.8] "The third watch passed. You were expected at the second."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus halts. His hand finds the toga fold again.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Defensive, Strained) [Stability: 0.5] "Crassipes brought word from the customs office. The ledgers—there are discrepancies. Varo's hands are in it, I know it. But the trail..."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He trails off. Drusilla crosses to the marble bench beside the impluvium and sits, her posture perfect, her gaze unblinking.

DRUSILLA: (Stoic, Low-Volume) [Stability: 0.85] "The trail is cold. Or cooling."

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Frustrated, Moralizing) [Stability: 0.45] "'Moribus antiquis res stat Romana virisque.' The old ways and the old men—that is what Ennius wrote. That is what holds Rome together. And Varo tears at it like a dog at carrion."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Drusilla lets the silence stretch. Three breaths. Four. When she speaks, her voice is soft as the lamp's dying hiss.

DRUSILLA: (Diagnostic, Intimate) [Stability: 0.8] "A dog tires itself, husband. It snaps at shadows. While the patient hunter waits at the burrow's mouth."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus turns to her. His shoulders drop, the defensive hunch easing.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Uncertain, Seeking) [Stability: 0.5] "You counsel delay?"

DRUSILLA: (Careful, Deliberate) [Stability: 0.85] "I counsel consolidation. You have friends in the Senate still. Let them speak of Varo's excesses. Let rumor do the labor your advocates cannot."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] She rises. Crosses to him. Places one hand—cool, steady—against his cheek.

DRUSILLA: (Warm, Controlled) [Stability: 0.9] "The house needs you whole. I need you whole."

Quintus covers her hand with his own. He does not see how her eyes slide toward the shrine, toward the shadows beyond it, calculating.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Resigned, Grateful) [Stability: 0.6] "So be it. A tenday, perhaps. To let the waters settle."

DRUSILLA: (Neutral, Final) [Stability: 0.9] "It is well."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] She guides him toward the corridor. The lamp gutters once more, and the ancestors' painted eyes seem to narrow.

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] In the darkness of the atrium, unseen, a folded wax tablet rests beneath Drusilla's discarded mantle—sealed with a device that is not the Fabii crest.

## SC12 — INT. VARO'S STUDY - NIGHT

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Oil lamps throw restless shadows across ledgers stacked like fortifications. The air tastes of old parchment and cold sweat. Caelus Varo stands at his desk, tugging at his short tunic as though it constricts him, his fingers moving across scattered tablets with the jerky precision of a man counting enemies.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] A slave enters, refills a wine cup that Varo ignores. The liquid trembles in the vessel.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus Licinius waits near the doorway, hands wiping unconsciously against his tunic. His eyes flick to the corridor behind him—measuring the distance to escape.

VARO: (Agitated, Clipped) [Stability: 0.4] "Three ships. Three. Impounded at Ostia. The weight of my grain fortune rotting in their holds while some magistrate's seal gathers dust."

MARCUS: (Cautious, Measured) [Stability: 0.5] "Dominus, the freeze is temporary. Legal delays favor those with patience. In thirty days—perhaps forty—the Advocate can—"

VARO: (Sharp, Interrupting) [Stability: 0.3] "Thirty days. Forty days."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He sweeps a wax tablet from the desk. It cracks against the mosaic floor.

VARO: (Contemptuous, Staccato) [Stability: 0.3] "You speak like a man who has never watched coin bleed from his accounts. Information arriving a watch early is worth more than a province, and you counsel me to wait?"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus steps forward, palms raised—a supplicant's gesture worn smooth by years of use.

MARCUS: (Nervous, Deferential) [Stability: 0.4] "The courts are markets, Dominus. The highest bidder wins. But one must know which purse to open, and when. If we move too quickly, we draw the Senate's eye—"

VARO: (Explosive, Profane) [Stability: 0.2] "The Senate? That theater for ugly men pretending at nobility?"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He rounds on Marcus, closing the distance between them. The accountant's eyes dart again to the exit.

VARO: (Venomous, Mathematical) [Stability: 0.3] "You count my denarii but not my dangers. I need action. Not patience. Not your trembling caution."

MARCUS: (Wounded, Precise) [Stability: 0.5] "I have served you fifteen years, Dominus. Every number in these ledgers bears my hand. Every—"

VARO: (Dismissive, Cold) [Stability: 0.4] "Every number proves you are useful. Not indispensable."

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] The word hangs between them like a blade.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus straightens slowly. Something shifts behind his calculating eyes—a weight settling, a sum being tallied for the first time.

MARCUS: (Quiet, Hollow) [Stability: 0.6] "It is well, Dominus. I shall prepare more... aggressive options."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He bows and retreats toward the door. His hands no longer wipe at his tunic.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Varo turns back to his scattered tablets, alone with his paranoia.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] MARCUS pauses at the threshold, speaking without turning.

MARCUS: (Neutral, Deliberate) [Stability: 0.7] "You know, Dominus—I have always wondered. When a man buries so many bodies... does he remember where he placed the shovel?"

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] He is gone before Varo can respond.

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] The oil lamp gutters. Shadows multiply.

## SC13 — EXT. THE ROMAN FORUM - MORNING

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Sunlight cuts sharp across the marble paving stones, gilding the columns of the Basilica Aemilia. The Forum thrums with its usual commerce—merchants hawking, clients seeking patrons, advocates rehearsing arguments beneath the rostra. The smell of fresh bread from a nearby stall mingles with the tang of sweat and ambition.
---END NARRATOR---

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Gaius Crassipes moves through the crowd with practiced ease, his toga freshly chalked, his smile ready. He touches a grain merchant's arm in greeting, laughs at a jest from a passing equestrian. All as it should be.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Then he sees it.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Crude letters scratched into the base of a statue—CRASSIPES LICKS THE PROSECUTOR'S SANDALS. A cluster of freedmen read it aloud, snickering. One mimics a groveling posture.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Crassipes's smile freezes.

A STREET VENDOR: (Mocking, Loud) [Stability: 0.7] "There he walks! The senator who begged for mercy and received none!"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Laughter ripples through the crowd. A boy throws an overripe fig. It spatters against the stones at Crassipes's feet.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Crassipes quickens his pace, but the whispers follow like flies on carrion. At every turn, fresh graffiti. On the wall of a tavern: THE ADVOCATE CRASSIPES—ASK HIM ABOUT HIS FAILED BARGAINS. Near the Temple of Castor: VARO'S DOG, BUT NOT A GOOD ONE.

A WOOL-SELLER: (Contemptuous, Casual) [Stability: 0.6] "My wife negotiates better than that man, and she cannot read."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] More laughter. Crassipes's hand drifts to his arm—the gesture meant for others, now turned inward, gripping his own flesh through the wool.

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Defensive, Strained) [Stability: 0.4] "These are lies. Slander. I have served this city—"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] No one listens. A group of young men take up a chant, their voices carrying across the stones: "Crassipes the Crawler! Crassipes the Crawler!"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He breaks into a near-run, dignity abandoned, heading for the shadow of the Tabularium. Behind him, a street artist adds another line to the growing graffiti: AND VARO REMEMBERS.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Crassipes presses himself against a column, chest heaving. His eyes dart across the Forum—seeing now what he missed before. The careful choreography of it. The agents positioned at corners. The timing of each insult. This is no random mockery.

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] This is architecture.

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Bitter, Quiet) [Stability: 0.3] "Every problem is a negotiation waiting to happen..."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He laughs—the sound hollow, mirthless. The laugh of a man who has just discovered the limits of his own philosophy.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Across the Forum, a figure in a plain tunic watches, then slips away toward the Palatine. The message delivered. The punishment complete.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Crassipes stares at his trembling hands. When he looks up, his expression has changed. Fear remains, but beneath it, something harder is forming.

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Cold, Resolved) [Stability: 0.5] "So. Varo wishes me to understand the weight of his displeasure."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He straightens his toga with deliberate care.

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Quiet, Dangerous) [Stability: 0.6] "Then let him understand this: even dogs have teeth."

## SC14 — INT. VARO'S STUDY - AFTERNOON

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Dust motes drift through slanted light where the shutters hang ajar. Scrolls lie scattered across the cedar desk—accounts, debts, leverage—the architecture of a man who counts the world in coins and favors. The smell of ink and old leather mingles with something sharper: wine gone sour in a forgotten cup.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Varo stands at the window, tugging at his short tunic, measuring the sun's descent toward the rooftops. His fingers drum against the sill. Three breaths. Four.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] The steward announces: Gaius Crassipes.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Varo does not turn.

CRASSIPES: (Warm, Measured) [Stability: 0.7] "Caelus, my friend. You've redecorated since my last visit. Or is that merely a new arrangement of your enemies' IOUs?"

VARO: (Clipped, Guarded) [Stability: 0.5] "Say what you came to say. I've no taste for pleasantries."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Crassipes crosses to the desk, fingers brushing a scroll as if by accident. He chuckles—the sound too ready, too warm for the cold room.

CRASSIPES: (Jovial, Probing) [Stability: 0.7] "The Forum speaks of nothing but your assault on Fabius. Brilliant theater. Devastating. And yet—"

VARO: (Cutting) [Stability: 0.4] "And yet what? He bleeds. Good. Let him bleed."

CRASSIPES: (Gentle, Insistent) [Stability: 0.6] "And yet you've given every cautious man in the Senate reason to fear you. Fear unites enemies, Caelus. It is the one currency that multiplies when spent."

Varo turns now, eyes narrow. His hand finds the window frame, knuckles white.

VARO: (Defensive, Mathematical) [Stability: 0.5] "I counted the votes. Fabius stands alone."

CRASSIPES: (Smooth, Double-Edged) [Stability: 0.7] "Today. But you burn too bright, too fast. Even allies begin to wonder: if he devours Fabius so publicly, what stops him devouring me?"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Crassipes moves closer, touches Varo's arm—light, familiar, calculated. His smile never wavers.

CRASSIPES: (Accommodating, Firm) [Stability: 0.7] "The blade in the dark serves better than the torch in the Forum. Let them see a statesman. Let them never see the knife."

Varo's jaw tightens. He checks the sun again—a breath closer to evening. When he speaks, the profanity is gone, replaced by something colder.

VARO: (Reluctant, Calculating) [Stability: 0.6] "You counsel patience. Fabius festers while I smile?"

CRASSIPES: (Satisfied, Conspiratorial) [Stability: 0.8] "Patience in public. Pressure in private. His accountant, Marcus—he reports to you still, does he not? Let the ledgers do what speeches cannot."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Varo is silent. His fingers still. Then—

VARO: (Measured, Dangerous) [Stability: 0.7] "So be it. I will wear the mask. But Crassipes—"

He steps close, voice dropping.

VARO: (Cold, Precise) [Stability: 0.7] "When the mask comes off, you had best be standing beside me. Not in front."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Crassipes laughs—this time, the warmth does not reach his eyes.

CRASSIPES: (Light, Unreadable) [Stability: 0.7] "Where else would I stand, my friend? The view is so much better from your shadow."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] The sun slips behind a cloud. The room dims.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Varo turns back to the window, and when he speaks, it is almost to himself.

VARO: (Quiet, Ominous) [Stability: 0.6] "Fabius believes he knows what I am. Let him learn what I become when I stop making noise."

## SC15 — INT. THE CROOKED CUP TAVERN - AFTERNOON

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Weak light filters through shutters warped by salt air, casting bars across a table where two amphorae stand untouched. The tavern smells of stale wine and fish oil. At the back, away from the handful of dock workers nursing their cups, a man in a toga too fine for this establishment sits across from another who cannot stop moving his hands.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] MARCUS LICINIUS wipes his palms against his tunic for the third time since sitting down. His eyes flick to the door, to the kitchen passage, back to the door.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] QUINTUS FABIUS MAXIMUS adjusts a fold of his toga, deliberate, unhurried. He has not touched the cup before him.

QUINTUS: (Measured, Paternal) [Stability: 0.7] "You keep accounts for Caelus Varo. Every denarius that passes through his hands—you have weighed it, recorded it, understood where it flows."

Marcus's fingers find the edge of his cup, rotate it without drinking.

MARCUS: (Guarded, Precise) [Stability: 0.5] "I keep records. Nothing more. Columns of figures. What they purchase is not my concern."

QUINTUS: (Soft, Probing) [Stability: 0.7] "Ennius wrote that mortal men have earned the gift of divinity through their deeds. But what of the man who enables another's corruption? Does he share in that stain?"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus's hand trembles. He pulls it from the cup.

MARCUS: (Nervous, Deflecting) [Stability: 0.4] "I am a freedman. I count. I tally. The weight of thirty thousand sesterces moved last month alone—that is what I know. Not philosophy."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus leans forward. His hand reaches toward the small leather purse at his belt, then stops. He withdraws it, deliberately refusing to produce coin.

QUINTUS: (Earnest, Determined) [Stability: 0.8] "I offer no gold. Varo offers gold aplenty, does he not? I offer something his coin cannot purchase."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] A serving girl—young, Numidian, her wrists bearing old rope scars—passes with a pitcher. Both men fall silent until she withdraws.

MARCUS: (Bitter, Calculating) [Stability: 0.4] "And what is that?"

QUINTUS: (Solemn, Weighted) [Stability: 0.7] "Immunity. The Praetor's word, sealed. Testify to what you have witnessed, and you walk free. The ancestors watch and judge every action, Marcus Licinius. What will they see when they look upon yours?"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus's eyes dart to the door once more. A docker at the front laughs at something. The sound dies quickly.

MARCUS: (Torn, Afraid) [Stability: 0.3] "Varo knows where the bodies are buried. He knows because—"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He stops himself. His throat works.

QUINTUS: (Gentle, Pressing) [Stability: 0.7] "Because he put them there. Yes. I know this. And so do you."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Silence stretches between them. Marcus wipes his hands again, leaving damp marks on the worn linen.

MARCUS: (Wavering, Desperate) [Stability: 0.3] "Give me... give me time. Three days. I must think on this."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus rises, adjusting his toga fold once more. He looks down at the accountant with something almost like pity.

QUINTUS: (Quiet, Final) [Stability: 0.8] "Three days, then. But consider this, freedman: Varo's gold will spend the same in your tomb as out of it."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He turns and walks toward the light of the doorway, leaving Marcus alone with his untouched wine and his trembling hands.

## SC16 — INT. VARO'S STUDY - EVENING

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
The brazier casts dancing shadows across the walls of Varo's archive room. Cedar shelves groan under the weight of scrolls and leather-bound ledgers. The air tastes of old ink and something sharper—fear, perhaps, or the copper tang of a man's conscience finally waking.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus Licinius stands alone before the flames, three ledgers clutched against his chest like a dying man clutching prayers. His hands are damp. He wipes them on his tunic, leaving dark streaks across the wool.

MARCUS: (Whispered, to himself) [Stability: 0.3] "Three ledgers. Forty-seven entries. Enough to see a man's neck stretched."

He steps toward the brazier. The heat licks at his face. His eyes dart to the doorway—no footsteps, no guards. Varo dines with Crassipes this night. The household slaves know better than to enter this room unbidden.

MARCUS: (Strained, trembling) [Stability: 0.3] "Burn them. Burn them and walk free. Is it not simple arithmetic?"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] His fingers find the first ledger's spine. He extends it toward the flames.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] And stops.

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Quintus's voice echoes in his memory—something about Rome, about what a man leaves behind when his accounts are finally settled. Marcus had dismissed it then. The idle philosophy of a man who never had to count another's coins to survive.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] But now, in the dancing light, he sees the names written in his own hand. The bribes. The false tallies. The shipments that arrived empty because Varo had already sold their cargo twice over.

MARCUS: (Bitter, resigned) [Stability: 0.4] "The courts are just another market. But markets... markets can be cornered."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He pulls the ledger back. Sets it on Varo's desk with exaggerated care.

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
From his belt pouch, he withdraws a blank wax tablet. His stylus moves with the precision of a man who has spent twenty winters turning lies into columns. He does not copy everything—only the weight of it. The essential entries. The names Varo believes are buried with the men who bore them.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] His eyes dart again to the door. His hand moves faster.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] When he finishes, Marcus wraps the tablet in a scrap of linen and slips it beneath a loose stone behind the third shelf—a hiding place he discovered while reorganizing Varo's wine accounts two summers past.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He replaces the ledgers exactly as he found them. Adjusts the brazier's coals.

MARCUS: (Controlled, calculating) [Stability: 0.5] "I have not chosen sides. I have merely... created options."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He smooths his tunic. Wipes his hands one final time.

MARCUS: (Cold, quiet) [Stability: 0.6] "Varo knows where the bodies are buried. But now, so do I."

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] He slips from the archive room like smoke from a dying fire, leaving the brazier to gutter and fade—and the evidence exactly where Varo left it, waiting for the hand that will finally reach for it.

## SC17 — INT. THE CROOKED CUP TAVERN - EVENING

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
Smoke from cheap tallow candles hangs low beneath warped ceiling beams. The tavern reeks of sour wine and ambition—every whispered conversation here trades in futures, most of them stolen. In the back corner, where the lamplight fails to reach, Gaius Crassipes has claimed a table with the ease of a man who knows that coin buys silence.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] A serving boy—gap-toothed, no older than twelve—brings a second cup without being asked. Crassipes presses a copper into his palm.

CRASSIPES: (Warm, Expansive) [Stability: 0.8] "Titus, isn't it? Your mother still works the fullers' quarter?"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] The boy nods, startled to be remembered, and retreats.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus Licinius enters through the side door, scanning the room twice before spotting his host. He wipes his hands on his tunic as he approaches—a nervous habit worn into the fabric itself. His eyes catalogue the exits: three. The patrons: eight. The armed men: two, both belonging to a wool merchant near the hearth.

CRASSIPES: (Jovial, Double-Meaning) [Stability: 0.7] "Marcus! Sit, sit. I've taken the liberty of ordering the Falernian. A poor vintage, but honest—rather like the company one finds here."

Marcus settles onto the bench, shoulders hunched.

MARCUS: (Nervous, Precise) [Stability: 0.4] "You asked about the Alexandrian shipments. The numbers don't lie, Crassipes. Three vessels delayed. The harbor master's ledgers show spoilage claims on two more."

Crassipes touches Marcus's arm—a gesture of friendship that lingers a breath too long.

CRASSIPES: (Smooth, Accommodating) [Stability: 0.8] "And what does our mutual friend Varo make of this shortage?"

MARCUS: (Calculating, Deferential) [Stability: 0.5] "He's holding reserves. Seven granaries worth. When the price rises—and it will, by the next market day—one part in ten of every sesterce spent on grain flows to his coffers."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Crassipes laughs—too readily, too warmly.

CRASSIPES: (Accommodating, Pointed) [Stability: 0.7] "You serve your patron well, Marcus. Though I wonder—does a man who counts another's gold ever dream of counting his own?"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus's eyes dart to the nearest exit. His hands find his tunic again.

MARCUS: (Defensive, Sharp) [Stability: 0.3] "Varo knows where every coin rests. Every debt. Every... body."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] A messenger boy appears at Crassipes's elbow—one of his own runners, breathless from the Forum. Crassipes scrawls instructions on a wax tablet without looking up: buy grain futures, all available contracts, before dawn.

CRASSIPES: (Smooth, Dismissive) [Stability: 0.8] "Run. Don't stop until my factor has this in hand."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] The boy vanishes. Crassipes turns back to Marcus, refilling his cup with paternal care.

CRASSIPES: (Jovial, Layered) [Stability: 0.7] "You're a good man, Marcus. Loyal. Though loyalty, I've found, flows best toward those who'll still be standing when the flood recedes."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus says nothing. His silence speaks in numbers—calculating odds, weighing patrons, measuring the distance to the door.

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Crassipes raises his cup in toast, smile never wavering.

CRASSIPES: (Warm, Ominous) [Stability: 0.8] "To Varo's health, then. May it last as long as it proves... useful."

## SC18 — INT. THE CROOKED CUP TAVERN - NIGHT

---NARRATOR---
(Ominous) [Stability: 0.7]
Smoke from cheap tallow candles hangs like burial shrouds beneath the low beams. The tavern keeper has been paid to vanish. Only the scuttling of rats behind the walls breaks the silence—that, and the drip of condensation from the ceiling onto Marcus Licinius's untouched cup of posca.
---END NARRATOR---

---NARRATOR---
(Neutral) [Stability: 0.8]
He sits in the corner booth, spine rigid against the damp wood. His hands move compulsively across his tunic, wiping, wiping. The door creaks. A figure in a dark palla glides through, face half-hidden, but he knows. Everyone knows Drusilla by her stillness.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] She takes the seat across from him. Does not speak. The silence stretches until Marcus's eyes dart to the kitchen passage, then the street door. Both blocked by shadows that were not there before.

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Nervous, Rapid) [Stability: 0.4] "Domina, this is—I was not expecting—the ledgers are in order, I swear by Jupiter's stone—"

DRUSILLA: (Clinical, Near-Whisper) [Stability: 0.8] "Your mother."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus freezes. His hand stops mid-wipe.

DRUSILLA: (Stoic, Measured) [Stability: 0.8] "Lucia Licinia. Widow. Lives in the Aventine insula, third floor. The stairs trouble her knees now. She takes barley water for her cough."

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Strangled, Defensive) [Stability: 0.3] "How do you—why would you—"

DRUSILLA: (Diagnostic, Unblinking) [Stability: 0.9] "Your sister's children. The twins. Gaius and Spurius. Seven summers old. They walk to the grammaticus alone each morning. The route passes three alleys without witnesses."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus's face drains of color. He grips the table edge. The cup of posca trembles, sends ripples across its surface.

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Desperate, Hushed) [Stability: 0.2] "Domina, I have served Varo faithfully for twelve years. I know every denarius, every transaction—"

DRUSILLA: (Low-Volume, Final) [Stability: 0.9] "Then you understand how books can be corrected. Entries erased. Names... removed."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] She rises. Her posture remains perfect, hands folded before her like a Vestal at prayer. She has not raised her voice. She has not needed to.

DRUSILLA: (Clinical, Soft) [Stability: 0.8] "Varo requires your continued discretion. I require your active cooperation. These are not different things."

MARCUS LICINIUS: (Broken, Barely Audible) [Stability: 0.2] "It is well. Whatever you need. It is well."

Drusilla pauses at the threshold. The shadows behind her have already dissolved into the night.

DRUSILLA: (Stoic, Quiet) [Stability: 0.9] "Men differ only in the price of their toys, Marcus. Your price is your blood. Remember that it remains... affordable."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] She is gone. Marcus sits alone in the guttering candlelight, hands shaking. When the tavern keeper returns three breaths later, he finds the accountant weeping silently into his palms.

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] The cup of posca has not been touched. It never will be.

## SC19 — INT. PUBLIC BATHS, FRIGIDARIUM — LATE NIGHT

---NARRATOR---
(Ominous) [Stability: 0.7]
The cold pool lies still as a dead man's eye. Torchlight from the colonnade throws wavering shadows across the marble, and the water reflects nothing but darkness. At this watch, the baths belong to rats and conspirators. The furnace slaves have banked their fires; the only warmth here is the kind that kills.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus Fabius Maximus stands at the pool's edge, toga adjusted precisely despite the chill. Across from him, the accountant Marcus Licinius clutches a leather satchel to his chest like a child might hold a stolen honey-cake. His sandals leave wet prints on the stone—he has been pacing.

MARCUS: (Nervous, Rapid) [Stability: 0.4] "I should not be here. If Varo learns I spoke to you—"

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] His eyes dart toward the entrance, then to the service corridor. Always mapping his retreat.

QUINTUS: (Cold, Imperious) [Stability: 0.7] "You summoned me from my bed with promises of evidence against that merchant-prince. Speak, or waste no more of my time."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He adjusts the fold of his toga. The gesture of a man who believes the ancestors watch.

MARCUS: (Calculating, Soft) [Stability: 0.5] "Not Varo's crimes, Prosecutor. His... associations."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Marcus wipes his hands on his tunic, leaving dark smears. He opens the satchel with trembling fingers and produces a wax tablet, then another. Five in total, arranged on the marble bench like offerings at a funeral.

MARCUS: (Deferential, Precise) [Stability: 0.4] "Eighteen thousand sesterces. Moved through a grain factor in Ostia. Twelve thousand more through a fullers' guild. The seal is concealed, but I know it."

QUINTUS: (Dismissive, Irritated) [Stability: 0.6] "Varo's laundered coin. I have suspected as much for—"

MARCUS: (Cutting, Desperate) [Stability: 0.3] "Not Varo's seal, Prosecutor."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He turns the largest tablet toward the torchlight. The wax bears an impression: a dove clutching laurel. Quintus goes still as temple stone.

MARCUS: (Quiet, Watching) [Stability: 0.5] "Your wife's. The Lady Drusilla's private mark."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] The silence stretches. Water drips somewhere in the dark. Quintus's hand moves toward the tablet, stops, trembles.

QUINTUS: (Strained, Breaking) [Stability: 0.3] "Forgeries. Varo has manufactured—"

MARCUS: (Precise, Relentless) [Stability: 0.5] "Three years of transactions. One part in ten of your household's reported income. I have the corresponding records from Varo's own ledgers. She has been his silent partner since the African grain shortage."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus staggers. His hand finds the column, grips it. The prosecutor who quotes Ennius, who lectures on ancestral virtue—he looks now like a man watching his house burn.

QUINTUS: (Hollow, Lost) [Stability: 0.2] "The weight of it... all this time, beneath my own roof..."

Marcus is already backing toward the shadows, satchel clutched tight again.

MARCUS: (Nervous, Final) [Stability: 0.4] "I have given you truth, Prosecutor. What you build from it—that burden is yours."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He vanishes into the service corridor. Quintus remains, staring at the tablets. The dove and laurel. His wife's secret, carved in wax.

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] The cold pool reflects his face: a man whose certainties have drowned.

QUINTUS: (Whispered, Hollow) [Stability: 0.2] "The only thing keeping this house standing."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He laughs—a sound like breaking pottery.

QUINTUS: (Bitter, To Himself) [Stability: 0.3] "And she was selling the foundations all along."

## SC20 — INT. FABIUS HOUSE - ATRIUM - LATE NIGHT

---NARRATOR---
(Ominous) [Stability: 0.7]
The impluvium reflects nothing. Oil lamps have burned low, their smoke hanging motionless beneath the painted ceiling where ancestors stare down with fixed disapproval. A letter lies open on the marble table between them—Varo's seal unmistakable, crimson wax cracked like a wound.
---END NARRATOR---

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus Fabius stands at the far column, his back to his wife. His fingers work the fold of his toga, adjusting, readjusting. The household slaves have been dismissed. Even the night porter holds his breath somewhere beyond the vestibulum.

DRUSILLA: (Clinical, Measured) [Stability: 0.8] "You have read it three times now."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Silence. The fountain drips. One drop. Another.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Strained, Without Turning) [Stability: 0.5] "Ennius wrote that fortune favors not the bold, but the prepared. I was neither."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Drusilla does not move from her seated position on the marble bench. Her posture remains architectural—spine aligned with the column behind her, hands folded precisely in her lap. She watches his shoulders, reading the tension there as a physician reads a pulse.

DRUSILLA: (Low, Diagnostic) [Stability: 0.8] "The letter concerns grain contracts. Not philosophy."

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Bitter, Still Averted) [Stability: 0.4] "Everything Varo touches becomes philosophy. The philosophy of rot."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] He turns at last. His face carries the hollowness of a man who has not slept, who has paced this atrium since the third watch began. His eyes avoid the letter as they would a corpse.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Accusatory, Defensive) [Stability: 0.4] "He writes to my house. My house. With terms. As though I were some freedman negotiating passage on his ships."

Drusilla's gaze does not waver. Unblinking. The silence stretches until it becomes its own pressure.

DRUSILLA: (Flat, Surgical) [Stability: 0.9] "You are negotiating. You simply refuse to name it."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] Quintus's hand freezes on his toga. The cloth bunches beneath white knuckles.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Wounded, Moralizing) [Stability: 0.3] "The ancestors—"

DRUSILLA: (Cutting, Final) [Stability: 0.9] "The ancestors are dead. Their grain stores are dust. Their Republic needed their swords. This one requires different instruments."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] She rises. One fluid motion. She crosses to the table and folds the letter closed with precise fingers, then slides it toward him.

DRUSILLA: (Quiet, Absolute) [Stability: 0.9] "You will respond by dawn. Or I will."

[NARRATOR]: (Neutral) [Stability: 0.8] She moves past him toward the corridor. At the threshold, she pauses—her profile carved in lamplight.

DRUSILLA: (Ice, Diagnostic) [Stability: 0.9] "Consider, husband: when a house needs both shield and blade, it is not the shield that cuts the terms."

[NARRATOR]: (Ominous) [Stability: 0.7] She vanishes into shadow. Quintus stares at the letter. His hand will not move to touch it.
