## SC01 — EXT. THE ROMAN FORUM - DAWN

Mist clings to the cobblestones like a shroud reluctant to lift. The Temple of Saturn rises gray against a sky bleeding pink at its eastern edge, its columns casting long shadows across the empty speaking platform. A crow circles the Rostra once, twice, then settles on the bronze prow of a ship—one of those ancient trophies bolted there since the wars with Antium.

The first sounds are small. Sandals on stone. The creak of a handcart's wooden wheel. A temple door groaning open somewhere beyond the Basilica Aemilia.

A FISH MERCHANT, bent under the weight of his pole and its hanging catch, shuffles past the Comitium. His companion, a GRAIN SELLER with flour dusting his forearms, walks beside him.

FISH MERCHANT: (Weary, Hushed) [Stability: 0.6] "Three nights now. Lictors at the Subura crossings. They took old Gnaeus from his stall—said he owed tribute to someone."

GRAIN SELLER: (Guarded, Low) [Stability: 0.5] "Tribute. A new word for theft." 

He glances toward the Senate House, its doors still barred.

GRAIN SELLER: (Bitter, Muttered) [Stability: 0.5] "The fathers sleep late while the rest of us wonder who vanishes next."

A HERALD emerges from the shadow of the Arch of Augustus, bronze horn tucked under his arm. He moves with the measured pace of a man who has walked this route ten thousand mornings. He passes the merchants without acknowledgment, ascending the Rostra steps.

The Forum is filling now. CITIZENS drift in through the archways—a freedman adjusting his cap, a matron with her slave trailing behind, two young men in student's garb debating in whispers they think no one hears.

The Herald reaches the platform's edge. He does not lift the horn. Not yet.

HERALD: (Neutral, Formal) [Stability: 0.8] "The Senate convenes at the third watch. By order of the Consul."

No one stops. No one reacts. The words dissolve into the ambient murmur of commerce beginning, prayers half-spoken, bargains struck in undertones.

But beneath the Arch, a HOODED FIGURE has paused. Face obscured. Hands hidden in the folds of a dark cloak. Watching.

The crow on the Rostra takes flight, its harsh cry splitting the morning air.

The Hooded Figure turns and melts back into the street, swallowed by the city that birthed him.

And the Herald, alone now on the speaking platform, looks down at the horn in his hands as if he has forgotten what it is for—or perhaps remembered too well what news it will soon carry.

HERALD: (Quiet, To Himself) [Stability: 0.4] "Three days. They give us three days to choose our masters."

## SC02 — INT. VARO'S STUDY - MORNING

Dawn light cuts through the latticed windows, striping the marble floor with gold and shadow. The air carries cedar smoke from a bronze tripod, masking the sweat of three messengers who stand dripping in the doorway. Scrolls cascade across Varo's desk—shipping manifests, harbor logs, a map of the grain routes from Alexandria pinned with lead weights. Wax tablets bearing calculations lie scattered like fallen leaves after a storm.

Varo does not look up. His stylus moves across a tablet, scratching figures.

VARO: (Clipped, impatient) [Stability: 0.7] "The Alexandrian fleet. Where?"

The first messenger, a gaunt man with salt-crusted sandals, steps forward.

MESSENGER PRIMUS: (Breathless, deferential) [Stability: 0.4] "Storm-bound at Creta, Dominus. Three days. Perhaps four."

Varo's stylus stops. He glances toward the window, checking the sun's angle against the roofline, then tugs at his short tunic—a merchant's garment, not a senator's toga.

VARO: (Cold, mathematical) [Stability: 0.8] "Four days. The Ostia warehouses hold perhaps six days of grain. After that—" He snaps his fingers. "Panic. Prices triple."

He rises, moving to the map, tracing the sea routes with a calloused finger. Behind him, Gaius Crassipes enters without announcement—a privilege of allies. The banker's bulk fills the doorway; his smile arrives before his greeting.

CRASSIPES: (Jovial, probing) [Stability: 0.6] "Caelus, my friend! Your slave tells me you've been awake since the third watch. Surely even your ledgers require rest—"

VARO: (Interrupting, staccato) [Stability: 0.7] "Skip the pleasantries. I need your network. Every banking house from here to Puteoli."

Crassipes touches Varo's arm—an intimate gesture, calculated warmth—and laughs too readily.

CRASSIPES: (Smooth, accommodating) [Stability: 0.6] "Such urgency. What fortune requires so many hands?"

Varo gestures at the manifests.

VARO: (Low, intense) [Stability: 0.7] "The grain fleet is delayed. I know this. The Senate does not. The merchants do not." He leans closer. "Information arriving one watch before the market opens is worth more than a province."

Crassipes's smile tightens, but his eyes sharpen—a predator scenting blood.

CRASSIPES: (Careful, double-meaning) [Stability: 0.6] "And you wish me to... facilitate purchases? Through various names, I assume. Discreetly."

VARO: (Profane, decisive) [Stability: 0.8] "Buy every cursed grain future you can find. Use the Capuan agents, the Neapolitan houses. Spread the purchases thin. When the shortage hits—" He snaps his fingers again. "—we hold the city's belly in our fists."

He tosses a heavy purse onto the desk. It lands with the unmistakable weight of gold.

Crassipes lifts the purse, testing its heft. His laugh this time carries genuine warmth.

CRASSIPES: (Admiring, conspiratorial) [Stability: 0.7] "The old families play at politics. You, Caelus—you understand the only game that matters."

Varo turns back to his maps, already dismissing him.

VARO: (Cold, certain) [Stability: 0.8] "Everyone eats. Everyone pays. The question is only—to whom."

He glances at the rising sun, calculating.

VARO: (Quiet, razor-sharp) [Stability: 0.9] "By noon tomorrow, half the Senate will owe us grain. And senators, Crassipes—senators remember their debts."

---

## SC03 — INT. FABIUS HOUSE - ATRIUM - MORNING

Pale light filters through the compluvium, casting a square of silver upon the impluvium's still water. The atrium smells of old wool and cedar—the scent of ancestors preserved in wax masks along the walls. Scrolls lie scattered across a marble table, their edges weighted with bronze figurines of Romulus and Remus.

Quintus Fabius Maximus stands with his back to the doorway, adjusting the fold of his toga obsessively, never quite satisfied. His fingers work the fabric as though it were armor.

Soft footsteps. Drusilla enters bearing a silver tray—a single cup of watered wine, a small bowl of figs. Her posture is immaculate. She moves like water finding its level.

DRUSILLA: (Calm, Measured) [Stability: 0.8] "You have not eaten. The body prosecutes poorly when starved."

She sets the tray beside his scrolls. Her eyes find his, and hold. Quintus does not turn.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Defensive, Bitter) [Stability: 0.5] "Ennius wrote: 'Moribus antiquis res stat Romana virisque.' The Republic stands on ancient custom and her men."

He finally turns, gesturing at the scattered documents.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Righteous, Strained) [Stability: 0.5] "Varo has forgotten this. He builds his fortune on Egyptian grain schemes while our fathers' graves go untended. Someone must remind him."

DRUSILLA: (Clinical, Low) [Stability: 0.8] "Someone. And that someone stakes this house upon the reminder."

She lifts the wine cup, extends it toward him. Her arm does not waver.

DRUSILLA: (Diagnostic, Soft) [Stability: 0.8] "Caelus Varo owns three tribunes. Perhaps four. His clients fill the Subura. You take a torch to a wasp nest, husband."

Quintus accepts the cup. His hand trembles—just slightly. He drinks deeply.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Defensive, Vulnerable) [Stability: 0.4] "You think me a fool."

DRUSILLA: (Neutral, Unblinking) [Stability: 0.9] "I think you righteous. Which is more dangerous."

She moves closer, adjusting his toga fold with practiced fingers—the gesture intimate, proprietary. Her touch lingers at his shoulder.

DRUSILLA: (Stoic, Deliberate) [Stability: 0.8] "Strike if you must. But let me know the hour before you strike. This house requires... preparation."

Quintus covers her hand with his own. The gesture is grateful. Dependent.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Softened, Weary) [Stability: 0.5] "What would I do without your counsel?"

Drusilla permits herself the ghost of a smile—a thing calculated to the last degree.

DRUSILLA: (Quiet, Ambiguous) [Stability: 0.9] "You would be precisely the man Varo expects."

She withdraws, moving toward the doorway. At the threshold, she pauses. Her shadow falls long across the impluvium's water.

DRUSILLA: (Cool, Final) [Stability: 0.9] "Eat the figs. They came from Varo's own orchards—a gift from his wife. I thought you should know the taste of his hospitality before you refuse it forever."

She is gone. Quintus stares at the bowl of figs as though they were coiled serpents.

---

## SC04 — INT. FABIUS HOUSE - ATRIUM - MORNING

Pale light filters through the compluvium, catching motes of dust that drift above the impluvium's still water. The household gods watch from their lararium as Quintus Fabius Maximus stands at the head of a heavy oak table, his toga arranged with deliberate severity. Two men in the plain tunics of legal clerks flank him—TERTIUS, gray-bearded and hunched over wax tablets, and young AULUS, whose stylus scratches without pause.

Quintus adjusts the fold of his toga at the shoulder, his jaw set.

QUINTUS: (Measured, Commanding) [Stability: 0.7] "The poet Ennius wrote: 'He who speaks falsely before the law shall find no shadow deep enough.' Varo has lived too long in shadows."

Tertius looks up from his tablets, exchanging a glance with Aulus.

TERTIUS: (Neutral, Deferential) [Stability: 0.6] "Dominus, the contracts Varo files with the treasury bear his seal alone. If there is corruption, it runs through hands other than his own."

QUINTUS: (Sharp, Probing) [Stability: 0.7] "Then whose hands?"

Aulus clears his throat, setting down his stylus.

AULUS: (Cautious, Informative) [Stability: 0.5] "There is an accountant. One Marcus. He prepares the ledgers, reconciles the grain tallies. Every falsified weight, every phantom shipment—his calculations would bear the proof."

Quintus turns from the table, pacing three steps toward the impluvium. The morning light catches his profile, carving deep lines around his mouth. He does not look at the small chest of coins sitting unopened near the household shrine.

QUINTUS: (Resolved, Cold) [Stability: 0.8] "A man who counts another's crimes counts his own days. This Marcus—he is bound to Varo?"

TERTIUS: (Knowing, Grim) [Stability: 0.6] "Bound by fear, Dominus. Varo keeps such men close. Tightly held. But the law may hold tighter still."

Quintus turns back, his hand falling flat upon the table.

QUINTUS: (Commanding, Final) [Stability: 0.8] "Then prepare the writ. A formal subpoena, sealed and witnessed. Marcus will answer before the quaestor—or answer to the consequences of refusal."

Aulus reaches for fresh wax, nodding.

AULUS: (Efficient, Subdued) [Stability: 0.6] "It shall be done before noon."

Quintus straightens, adjusting his toga fold once more. His gaze drifts briefly toward the lararium, toward the bronze faces of ancestors long dead.

QUINTUS: (Quiet, To Himself) [Stability: 0.7] "The ancestors watch. Let them see one house that remembers what honor costs."

Tertius rolls the tablets closed and rises. Aulus follows. They bow and withdraw toward the vestibulum, leaving Quintus alone with the still water and the silent gods.

He stares into the impluvium's reflection. His own face stares back—older than he remembers.

QUINTUS: (Low, Dangerous) [Stability: 0.7] "Come then, Varo. Let us see which of us the law devours first."

The water ripples. Somewhere beyond the atrium, a door closes.

---

## SC05 — EXT. THE ROMAN FORUM - NOON

The sun stands at its zenith, hammering the marble steps of the Temple of Saturn with merciless light. Smoke from the sacrificial altar mingles with the reek of sweat and copper—coin-metal, blood-metal. The Forum seethes. Ten thousand voices rise and fall like surf against stone.

Quintus Fabius Maximus stands upon the Rostra, his toga praetexta immaculate despite the press of bodies below. Behind him, two lictors bearing fasces. Before him, chaos given human form.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Resolute, Commanding) [Stability: 0.8] "By the authority vested in this office, I declare the assets of Caelus Varo—his warehouses, his grain stores, his vessels at Ostia—sealed pending investigation for crimes against the Treasury of Rome."

A clerk named Spurius affixes the red wax seal to the proclamation. The crowd shifts. Murmurs become shouts.

MERCHANT 1: (Panicked, Desperate) [Stability: 0.3] "Varo holds my notes! Three hundred thousand sesterces—my family's fortune!"

The cry spreads like fire through dry wheat. A grain merchant named Decimus shoves toward the platform, face ashen.

DECIMUS: (Frantic, Pleading) [Stability: 0.2] "The Egyptian shipment—Varo's credit backed our purchase! Without his coin, we cannot pay the sailors!"

Quintus adjusts the fold of his toga. Does not look at the gold denarii some desperate fool has scattered at the Rostra's base.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Defensive, Measured) [Stability: 0.7] "The ancestors teach us—'moribus antiquis stat res Romana virisque.' Rome stands on ancient custom and on men of virtue. Profit without labor is a cancer. I cut it out."

But the Forum does not hear virtue. It hears ruin.

A banker's stall collapses as clients surge forward demanding coin. The money-changers at the Basilica Aemilia slam their shutters. The crash of bronze tablets echoes off temple walls—debts called in, credit vanished, the intricate web of Roman commerce unraveling in the span of fifty breaths.

OFFICIAL: (Urgent, Lowered voice) [Stability: 0.5] "Dominus—the Subura moneylenders have closed their doors. The plebs are already gathering torches."

Quintus watches a woman clutch her children as a grain-seller boards his shop with trembling hands. His jaw tightens. This was meant to wound Varo. Instead, Rome bleeds.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Troubled, Quiet) [Stability: 0.5] "The corruption had to be excised. The fever will break."

SPURIUS: (Nervous, Hesitant) [Stability: 0.4] "Dominus... Varo's men are already in the streets. They say you have destroyed more wealth in a morning than Hannibal took in a season."

Quintus finally looks down at the gold coins scattered before him. They gleam like accusations.

QUINTUS FABIUS: (Grim, Hardening) [Stability: 0.6] "Let them say what they will. When the ledgers are opened, Rome will know who truly plundered her."

He descends from the Rostra. The crowd parts—whether from respect or fear, even he cannot tell.

In the shadow of the Temple of Castor, a boy runs toward the Palatine, carrying a message sealed in black wax. Varo will know within the space of a hundred heartbeats.

And Varo does not forget.

---

## SC06 — INT. VARO'S STUDY - AFTERNOON

Dust motes hang suspended in the amber light slanting through high windows. Wax tablets lie scattered across a cedar desk, their surfaces gouged with fresh calculations—half-finished, abandoned. The room smells of old ink and newer sweat.

Varo paces before a map of the city's grain routes, his short tunic riding up as he moves. He tugs it down. Tugs again. His shadow cuts across painted districts like a blade.

VARO: (Fury, Staccato) [Stability: 0.3] "They send Lictors to my warehouses. MY warehouses. As if I were some provincial freedman with falsified ledgers."

Crassipes settles into a cushioned chair, uninvited but unhurried. He pours wine from a waiting amphora, the sound deliberate, almost theatrical.

CRASSIPES: (Measured, Accommodating) [Stability: 0.7] "I heard. The whole Aventine heard. Your steward's voice carries remarkably well when he's refusing entry to armed men."

VARO: (Defensive, Impatient) [Stability: 0.4] "Let them count every grain. Every damned amphora. The numbers are clean."

He checks the sun's position through the window. Checks again. His fingers drum against the map.

CRASSIPES: (Smooth, Double-meaning) [Stability: 0.7] "Clean numbers matter little when dirty hands present them, old friend."

Crassipes rises, touches Varo's arm—a gesture that stills the pacing. His laugh comes too easily, too warm for the tension in the room.

CRASSIPES: (Jovial, Calculated) [Stability: 0.8] "You forget—I have navigated three Consular investigations. Each one ended with my enemies explaining themselves to the Tiber."

VARO: (Suspicious, Mathematical) [Stability: 0.5] "And what did that cost you? One part in ten? More?"

CRASSIPES: (Accommodating, Wise) [Stability: 0.7] "It cost patience. The rarest currency in Rome."

He guides Varo toward the desk, clearing space among the scattered tablets. A slave appears at the threshold—young, Greek by his features—and Crassipes waves him away without looking.

CRASSIPES: (Determined, Strategic) [Stability: 0.8] "Fabius moves against you because he believes you isolated. Prove him wrong. Let me speak with Cornelius tomorrow. You will dine with Senator Metellus before the week ends. We build a wall of obligation around this investigation."

Varo's shoulders settle. The tugging stops. He studies Crassipes as one studies a ledger—calculating weight, measuring worth.

VARO: (Grudging, Controlled) [Stability: 0.6] "And if Fabius's advocate finds something before your wall is built?"

Crassipes smiles—the expression of a man who has already counted every outcome.

CRASSIPES: (Smooth, Ominous) [Stability: 0.8] "Then we ensure the advocate finds something far more interesting elsewhere. Every man follows a trail, Varo. We simply choose where it leads."

Varo nods slowly. His hand finds the map again, but this time his finger traces routes with purpose rather than rage.

VARO: (Cold, Resolved) [Stability: 0.7] "So be it. But if this costs me the Ostian contracts—"

CRASSIPES: (Jovial, Threatening) [Stability: 0.7] "It will cost Fabius considerably more. Information arriving at dawn is worth more than a province, yes? I know what arrives at his door each morning."

The afternoon light has shifted. Neither man notices. They are already elsewhere—three moves ahead, counting bodies not yet fallen.

---

## SC07 — INT. THE CROOKED CUP TAVERN - EVENING

Smoke curls from cheap tallow candles, their weak flames throwing shadows across wine-stained tables. The tavern reeks of sour wine and fear-sweat. In the far corner, away from the dockhands nursing their cups, Caelus Varo sits with his back to the wall. His fingers drum the table—counting something invisible.

Marcus Licinius enters, eyes sweeping the room like a hunted animal. He spots Varo and his hand goes immediately to his tunic, wiping, wiping.

VARO: (Impatient, clipped) [Stability: 0.7] "You're late. I counted forty-three breaths past when you should have been here."

Marcus slides onto the bench opposite, keeping one shoulder angled toward the door.

MARCUS: (Nervous, rapid) [Stability: 0.4] "The subpoena came. Three lictors. They want the ledgers from the Aventine warehouses. The grain accounts. Everything."

Varo tugs at his short tunic, a muscle jumping in his jaw. A serving girl moves past; he waves her away without looking.

VARO: (Hard, mathematical) [Stability: 0.6] "How many pages?"

MARCUS: (Calculating, fearful) [Stability: 0.3] "Forty-seven. Maybe fifty if they demand the supplemental tallies. Twelve thousand sesterces that cannot be explained. The weight of it—"

VARO: (Interrupting, profane) [Stability: 0.5] "Fuck the weight. Numbers are nothing. Numbers can burn."

Marcus's hands flutter to his tunic again. His eyes dart to the exit.

MARCUS: (Desperate, deferential) [Stability: 0.3] "Dominus, if I refuse the Quaestor's summons—"

VARO: (Controlled, dangerous) [Stability: 0.7] "You won't refuse. You'll appear. You'll be the perfect little accountant, confused by your own records."

Varo reaches into his cloak and withdraws a leather pouch. It lands on the table with the unmistakable weight of gold. Five aurei gleam in the candlelight.

VARO: (Direct, cold) [Stability: 0.8] "Everyone has a price. This is yours. Take it."

Marcus stares at the coins. His hand trembles as it moves toward them.

MARCUS: (Anguished, quiet) [Stability: 0.4] "And the ledgers?"

VARO: (Staccato, final) [Stability: 0.7] "Lose them. Misplace them. If necessary—" He mimes striking flint. "—accidents happen in warehouses."

Marcus's fingers close around the pouch. The leather creaks. Something dies behind his eyes.

MARCUS: (Hollow, broken) [Stability: 0.3] "It is well. I am... your man."

VARO: (Satisfied, predatory) [Stability: 0.8] "You always were."

Varo rises, adjusting his tunic, checking the fading light through the tavern's single high window. Third watch approaches.

VARO: (Quiet, threatening) [Stability: 0.7] "Remember, Marcus—the courts are just another market. I always pay my debts."

He pauses at Marcus's shoulder, voice dropping to a whisper.

VARO: (Intimate, dangerous) [Stability: 0.8] "Both kinds."

Marcus sits alone, the gold heavy in his palm, staring at the door long after Varo has vanished into the evening crowds.

---

## SC08 — EXT. THE ROMAN FORUM - EVENING

The dying sun bleeds copper across the Temple of Saturn's columns, casting long shadows that stripe the worn travertine like prison bars. Merchants fold their awnings. The day's last petitioners drift toward the basilica steps, their sandals scraping stone still warm from the afternoon heat. A crowd lingers near the Rostra—senators, their clients, a few grain-traders hoping to catch a patron's eye.

Quintus Fabius Maximus stands with two companions near the Column of Maenias, adjusting the precise fold of his toga praetexta. His fingers work the wool as if arranging armor.

Caelus Varo approaches from the direction of the Basilica Aemilia, his tunic deliberately short, his stride too fast for the Forum's measured dignity. He tugs at the hem. Checks the sun's position against the Temple roof. His lips move silently—counting something.

A grain-merchant named Spurius nudges his companion. They watch.

VARO: (Sharp, Calculated) [Stability: 0.7] "Quintus Fabius. Still here? I thought your ancestors preferred to do their business in shadow."

Quintus stiffens. His hand freezes on his toga fold.

QUINTUS: (Guarded, Measured) [Stability: 0.6] "Varo. The Forum belongs to all citizens. Even those who confuse commerce with virtue."

Varo laughs—a sound like coins dropped on marble. He turns to address the gathering crowd, arms spread wide.

VARO: (Theatrical, Venomous) [Stability: 0.7] "Citizens! Here stands Quintus Fabius Maximus. Moralist. Traditionalist. Descendant of the great Cunctator himself." He pauses. His voice drops to something intimate, something worse. "Tell me, Quintus—when your grandfather sold short-weight grain during the Hannibalic famine, did the ancestors watch then too?"

The crowd's murmur rises like wind before a storm. Spurius exchanges a look with his companion.

QUINTUS: (Wounded, Struggling) [Stability: 0.4] "You speak lies. Slander. My house has served Rome for—"

VARO: (Cutting, Precise) [Stability: 0.8] "Three hundred years. Yes. Three hundred years of selling rotten grain to starving legionaries while your women wore Tyrian purple." He steps closer. "I have the ledgers, Fabius. Ink fades. Numbers do not."

Quintus's face drains of color. He will not look at the crowd. He quotes, reflexively—

QUINTUS: (Desperate, Hollow) [Stability: 0.3] "Moribus antiquis res stat Romana virisque..."

VARO: (Contemptuous, Final) [Stability: 0.8] "Ennius. How fitting. A dead poet defending dead honor."

Varo turns on his heel and walks away. The crowd parts for him. Whispers multiply like flies on carrion.

Quintus stands alone. His hand falls from his toga. The fold has come undone.

Spurius leans to his companion, voice low: "The Fabii are finished."

But across the Forum, near the shadow of the Temple of Castor, a slave in Fabius household colors watches. And remembers.

Varo's voice carries back, not turning: "Ask your wife, Quintus. She knows what true ledgers contain."

---

## SC09 — INT. FABIUS HOUSE - ATRIUM - LATE NIGHT

A single oil lamp throws trembling shadows across the impluvium. The household sleeps, but beneath the lararium, behind a panel disguised as decorative scrollwork, lies a chamber no slave has ever cleaned.

Drusilla moves through the darkness like water finding its level. Her sleeping gown has been exchanged for a simple tunica—practical, forgettable. She presses three tiles in sequence. Stone grinds against stone.

The hidden room smells of cedar and old wax. Tablets line the walls, each marked with symbols that correspond to no Roman accounting system. She lights a second lamp, positions it beside her private ledgers, and begins.

DRUSILLA: (Clinical, barely audible) [Stability: 0.8] "Grain futures from Ostia. The Sardinian mines. The Egyptian textile routes."

Her finger traces columns of figures. Where her husband sees an investigation into Varo's corruption, she sees opportunity—advance knowledge of which merchants will face prosecution, which contracts will suddenly need new partners.

A soft knock. Three taps, pause, two more.

Drusilla does not startle. She opens the door a hand's width.

A MESSENGER stands in the corridor, face gaunt from too many sleepless nights running between the Fabius villa and the harbor. Behind him, a second figure waits—a SCRIBE carrying sealed tablets.

MESSENGER: (Exhausted, deferential) [Stability: 0.5] "Domina. The Alexandrian shipment clears port at dawn. Varo's agent secured the manifest adjustments as requested."

Drusilla takes the sealed tablets without expression. Her eyes move across the wax with the precision of a physician examining a wound.

DRUSILLA: (Satisfied, controlled) [Stability: 0.8] "The margin on the Cyrenaican grain?"

MESSENGER: (Nervous) [Stability: 0.4] "Fourteen talents, Domina. Perhaps more when the shortage takes hold."

Fourteen talents. Enough to buy a senator's loyalty. Enough to make a widow comfortable for life. She permits herself the ghost of a smile—gone before the lamplight catches it.

DRUSILLA: (Commanding, low) [Stability: 0.9] "Distribute six talents through the usual channels. The rest goes to the Puteoli account. Varo's name appears nowhere."

She produces a stylus and begins inscribing a coded response on fresh wax—instructions that will reach Varo's networks before sunrise.

SCRIBE: (Hesitant) [Stability: 0.5] "Domina... if the Consul discovers—"

Drusilla's gaze rises. Unblinking. The scribe's words die in his throat.

DRUSILLA: (Cold, diagnostic) [Stability: 0.9] "My husband hunts shadows while I count the coins they drop. He believes himself the hunter in this house."

She seals the tablet with a ring that bears no family crest—anonymous, untraceable.

DRUSILLA: (Quiet, final) [Stability: 0.8] "Let him believe what keeps him useful."

The messengers withdraw. Drusilla extinguishes the lamp and stands alone in perfect darkness, wealth accumulating in distant ports while her husband dreams of justice beside an empty bed.

Somewhere in the house, a door creaks. Footsteps. Her husband's voice, sleep-thick, calling her name.

She does not answer. Not yet. Let him wonder where his loyal wife has gone.

---

## SC10 — EXT. THE ROMAN FORUM - NIGHT

Torchlight from the Temple of Saturn throws long shadows across empty flagstones. The shops are shuttered, the money-changers gone. Only the bronze she-wolf watches from her plinth as two figures meet beneath the Rostra, where orators thunder by day but now only whispers dare.

Gaius Crassipes waits in a rough-spun cloak, his banker's rings hidden beneath wool. His breath mists in the cold air. A serving boy stands three paces back, holding a small cedar chest.

Quintus Fabius Maximus approaches from the direction of the Basilica Aemilia, his toga's distinctive purple border visible even in this light. He adjusts the fold at his shoulder—once, twice—before stopping at arm's length.

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Warm, Practiced ease) [Stability: 0.7] "Quintus Fabius. How many years since we stood together at Lucius's triumph? You had just won your first case. The crowd loved you."

He reaches out, touches Quintus's arm. Quintus does not return the gesture.

QUINTUS FABIUS MAXIMUS: (Cold, Measured) [Stability: 0.6] "You did not summon me to the Forum at third watch to reminisce, Crassipes. Speak your purpose."

Crassipes laughs—too readily, the sound swallowed by darkness. He gestures to the serving boy, who opens the cedar chest. Gold coins gleam within, catching torchlight.

Quintus turns his face away.

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Smooth, Double-meaning) [Stability: 0.7] "A practical matter. Certain accounts—minor discrepancies in the grain contracts—these things complicate an investigation. Muddy the waters. Perhaps your inquiry need not wade so deep into the Tiber's mud?"

QUINTUS FABIUS MAXIMUS: (Bitter, Rising heat) [Stability: 0.5] "You speak of Varo's accounts. His theft from the public stores."

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Accommodating, Gentle pressure) [Stability: 0.6] "I speak of complications. Your wife—the Lady Drusilla—she keeps your household standing, does she not? The burdens she carries. This gold might ease—"

Quintus steps forward. His hand finds the chest's lid and slams it shut.

QUINTUS FABIUS MAXIMUS: (Righteous, Barely contained) [Stability: 0.4] "Ennius wrote: 'Moribus antiquis res stat Romana virisque.' The Republic stands on ancient custom and her men. Not on your master's coin."

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Frustrated, Mask slipping) [Stability: 0.5] "You are a man of principle, Quintus. I respect that. Truly. But the old families cannot hold the future at bay forever."

QUINTUS FABIUS MAXIMUS: (Defiant, Quiet steel) [Stability: 0.6] "Then let the future come honestly, or not at all. Tell Varo his gold means nothing. The investigation continues."

He turns and walks into shadow. Crassipes watches him go, then looks down at the closed chest.

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (To himself, Soft menace) [Stability: 0.7] "Principle. Such a brittle thing to stake a family upon."

The serving boy shifts uneasily. Somewhere in the dark, a dog howls.

Crassipes touches the cedar lid, almost tenderly.

GAIUS CRASSIPES: (Quiet, Resolved) [Stability: 0.8] "Send word to Varo. The Fabii have chosen the harder road. Let us see how far they walk it."

---

## SC11 — EXT. THE ROMAN FORUM - NIGHT

Torchlight bleeds across the marble steps of the Temple of Saturn, casting long shadows between the columns. The Forum lies empty at this hour—empty save for the rats, the beggars huddled beneath the Rostra, and Marcus Licinius, who stumbles from behind a statue of Janus with wine-stink on his breath and terror in his eyes.

Quintus Fabius Maximus draws his toga tighter against the chill. He has come because the summons was desperate. He will leave wishing he had not.

MARCUS: (Frantic, slurred) [Stability: 0.3] "Quintus Fabius—Quintus, please, a breath of your time. Only a breath."

Marcus wipes his palms on his tunic, leaving dark streaks. His eyes dart to the colonnade, to the shadows pooling at the base of the Basilica Aemilia.

QUINTUS: (Cold, measured) [Stability: 0.7] "You reek of Falernian and fear, accountant. Speak, if you must. But do not waste what patience the hour has left me."

MARCUS: (Desperate, confessional) [Stability: 0.2] "The grain futures. For seven months—seven—Varo has been bleeding the harvest before it leaves Alexandria. Phantom ships. Ledgers that vanish. I kept the tallies, Quintus. Gods forgive me, I kept every one."

He lurches closer. Quintus does not retreat, but his hand moves to the fold of his toga, adjusting it like armor.

QUINTUS: (Contemptuous, quoting) [Stability: 0.6] "'The man who counts another's coin soon loses count of his own soul.' Ennius knew your kind."

MARCUS: (Breaking, anguished) [Stability: 0.2] "You do not understand! The payments—there is a company, a shell, nothing but names and seals. But the coin flows to one house. YOUR house."

Quintus goes still. The torchlight flickers.

QUINTUS: (Dangerous, quiet) [Stability: 0.5] "Choose your next words as if the ancestors themselves were listening. Because they are."

MARCUS: (Terrified, precise) [Stability: 0.3] "Drusilla. Your wife. Forty thousand sesterces since the Kalends of Martius. I have seen the seals. I have COUNTED the coin."

Quintus staggers back as though struck. His face drains of color. For a long moment, he cannot speak—this man who quotes the old poets, who believes his wife the pillar of his house.

QUINTUS: (Devastated, hollow) [Stability: 0.4] "You lie. You must lie."

MARCUS: (Pleading, desperate) [Stability: 0.2] "Would that I did, Dominus. Would that I did."

In the shadows beneath the Basilica, two figures shift. One raises a hand—a signal. The other melts backward into the darkness, moving toward the Subura with purpose.

Varo's men have seen enough.

Quintus turns away, his toga suddenly too heavy, his dignitas crumbling like old mortar. Marcus watches him go, then looks to the Temple of Saturn—where oaths are sworn and broken.

MARCUS: (Hollow, to himself) [Stability: 0.3] "The books always balance. One way or another."

From somewhere in the Forum, a dog begins to howl—and in the Palatine above, a lamp burns in Caelus Varo's study, waiting for news that is already on its way.

---

## SC12 — INT. THE CROOKED CUP TAVERN, UPPER ROOM - NIGHT

Smoke curls thick as wool through the cramped chamber. A brazier, meant for warmth, now devours scrolls—the flames casting Marcus's shadow huge and trembling against the cracked plaster. Below, the tavern's noise masks his destruction. Almost.

Marcus feeds another ledger to the fire, hands shaking so violently that parchment tears. His eyes dart between the brazier and the single shuttered window. Three more ledgers wait. Three more witnesses to Varo's grain scheme.

MARCUS: (Muttering, frantic) [Stability: 0.3] "Two hundred amphorae at Ostia. The Sicilian shipments. Burn it all, burn it—"

He wipes his hands on his tunic, leaving ash-grey streaks. The smoke thickens. His eyes water.

Below, a woman's voice rises sharp: "Fire! There's fire above!"

Marcus freezes. The brazier crackles, indifferent. Footsteps pound the wooden stairs.

MARCUS: (Panicked, hissing) [Stability: 0.2] "No. No, not yet. I need—"

He grabs the remaining ledgers, but his hands betray him. One tumbles, spilling open on the floor—columns of figures, names, dates. Varo's signature, clear as a death warrant.

The door splinters inward. A TAVERN KEEPER, thick-armed and furious, barrels through with a water bucket. Behind him, a YOUNG SERVING BOY gapes at the smoke.

TAVERN KEEPER: (Enraged, commanding) [Stability: 0.7] "Gods below! You trying to burn us all alive, fool?"

He hurls water on the brazier. Steam and ash explode upward. Marcus stumbles back, clutching two ledgers to his chest like stolen children.

MARCUS: (Desperate, pleading) [Stability: 0.3] "It was an accident—the coals, they scattered—I'll pay for damages, whatever the cost—"

The Tavern Keeper's eyes fall to the fallen ledger. The columns. The figures.

TAVERN KEEPER: (Suspicious, slow) [Stability: 0.6] "What manner of accounts need burning at the third watch?"

Marcus's face goes grey as the ash coating his fingers. The Young Serving Boy edges closer, peering at the scattered parchment.

YOUNG SERVING BOY: (Curious, innocent) [Stability: 0.8] "Those are shipping marks, aren't they? My father worked the docks—"

MARCUS: (Threatening, shrill) [Stability: 0.2] "Touch nothing! This is—these are private affairs of my patron. You understand nothing!"

He wipes his hands again, compulsively. His eyes find the window. The drop would break bones, but bones heal. Witnesses do not forget.

The Tavern Keeper blocks the door now, arms crossed. Somewhere in the street below, a voice calls for the Vigiles.

TAVERN KEEPER: (Cold, decided) [Stability: 0.7] "Private affairs that smoke like a pyre. You'll wait here, accountant. The Watch will sort what's worth burning and what's worth saving."

Marcus looks at the ruined brazier, the fallen ledger, the two he still clutches. Half-destroyed. Half-intact. Enough to damn, not enough to damn completely.

MARCUS: (Hollow, realizing) [Stability: 0.3] "Varo will know. By dawn, Varo will know."

The Tavern Keeper's smile holds no warmth.

TAVERN KEEPER: (Grim, quiet) [Stability: 0.7] "Then I'd spend tonight praying your patron values you more than whatever you were burning."

## SC13 — INT. FABIUS HOUSE - ATRIUM - NIGHT

Oil lamps throw wavering shadows across the impluvium, the water black and still as a seer's mirror. The household slaves have been dismissed—only the distant scrape of a broom somewhere in the servants' quarters breaks the silence. Quintus stands before the lararium, his back to his wife, one hand adjusting the fold of his toga as if armor could be made from wool.

Drusilla sits on the marble bench beside the reflecting pool, her posture perfect, her eyes fixed on her husband's shoulder blades. She has not blinked in three breaths.

QUINTUS: (Controlled, Strained) [Stability: 0.5] "You took silver from Varo. From *Varo*." 

He does not turn. His fingers find the toga's edge again, worrying the fabric.

QUINTUS: (Bitter, Measured) [Stability: 0.5] "Ennius wrote that the man who sells his honor piece by piece wakes one morning to find he has sold himself entire. Did you think I would not discover it?"

DRUSILLA: (Clinical, Soft) [Stability: 0.8] "I think you discovered it precisely when I intended you to."

Quintus turns at last. His jaw works, but she is already continuing, her voice low as a physician delivering prognosis.

DRUSILLA: (Measured, Diagnostic) [Stability: 0.8] "The grain contracts are failing. Gaius Crassipes whispers that the Senate may move against our interests in Sicilia. I took insurance. Nothing more."

QUINTUS: (Frustrated, Rising) [Stability: 0.4] "Insurance? You call it insurance? That man would see this house burned to ash if it served his ledgers!"

He steps toward her. She does not flinch. Does not move at all.

DRUSILLA: (Stoic, Unblinking) [Stability: 0.7] "Then I have placed a portion of our fortune where the fire cannot reach it."

QUINTUS: (Wounded, Defensive) [Stability: 0.4] "The ancestors watch, Drusilla. They watch and they judge—"

DRUSILLA: (Cool, Precise) [Stability: 0.8] "The ancestors are dead. Our children are not. I will do what preserves them."

Silence. The lamp flames shudder in some imperceptible draft. Quintus's hand moves toward her, then falls. He cannot bridge this distance. He needs her too desperately to try.

QUINTUS: (Defeated, Quiet) [Stability: 0.4] "You have made me complicit in my own ruin."

DRUSILLA: (Soft, Final) [Stability: 0.7] "I have made you *surviving*, husband. The distinction matters only to the living."

She rises, smooth as water finding its level, and moves toward the corridor. At the threshold she pauses, her profile lit by flickering bronze light.

DRUSILLA: (Neutral, Deliberate) [Stability: 0.8] "When Varo calls upon us—and he will—you may refuse him nothing. That was the price."

She is gone before he can answer. Quintus stands alone in the atrium, staring at the black water, at his own fractured reflection.

---

## SC14 — INT. PUBLIC BATHS - MORNING

Steam rises from the caldarium in slow, deliberate coils, transforming the marble columns into ghosts of themselves. The morning crowd has not yet arrived—only a scattered few, their voices swallowed by water and stone. In the tepidarium's antechamber, where the heat is bearable and the walls thick, Drusilla waits. Her stola is simple. Her posture is not.

Marcus Licinius enters through the servants' passage, escorted by a bath attendant who vanishes at Drusilla's nod. He stands dripping, wrapped in linen, eyes already measuring the distance to every exit.

DRUSILLA: (Clinical, measured) [Stability: 0.8] "You arrived through the back. Good. You understand discretion."

Marcus wipes his palms against his tunic. The gesture is quick, compulsive.

MARCUS: (Nervous, deferential) [Stability: 0.4] "The Domina requested. I attend. But I do not understand why—"

DRUSILLA: (Low, diagnostic) [Stability: 0.8] "Because Varo is looking for leaks. And you, Marcus Licinius, are damp."

She lets the silence work. Three breaths. Four. Marcus shifts his weight, calculating, always calculating—the habit of a man who thinks in ledgers.

MARCUS: (Precise, fearful) [Stability: 0.3] "I have given him no cause—"

DRUSILLA: (Stoic, interrupting) [Stability: 0.7] "You have given him numbers. Numbers that lead to questions. Questions that lead to names." She tilts her head, unblinking. "My name, among others."

Marcus's eyes dart to the doorway. A slave passes, carrying towels. Neither moves until the footsteps fade.

MARCUS: (Calculating, desperate) [Stability: 0.4] "What do you want from me?"

DRUSILLA: (Clinical, soft) [Stability: 0.8] "Your silence. Which you will give me freely, or not at all—but you will give it."

She produces a small wax tablet from beneath her palla. Sets it on the stone bench between them.

DRUSILLA: (Measured, final) [Stability: 0.8] "A letter of introduction to my husband's grain factor in Puteoli. Should you need to... travel. Should Varo's attention grow too warm."

Marcus stares at the tablet. His hands tremble, but he does not reach for it.

MARCUS: (Nervous, probing) [Stability: 0.4] "And if I speak to Varo of this meeting?"

DRUSILLA: (Cold, absolute) [Stability: 0.9] "Then you will learn what I learned long ago: that Varo disposes of men who bring him problems. And you, Marcus, would become a problem the moment you opened your mouth."

She rises. The steam swirls around her like a veil being drawn.

DRUSILLA: (Clinical, quiet) [Stability: 0.8] "Take the tablet. Say nothing. When the time comes, I will send word."

Marcus takes it. His fingers are cold against the wax.

MARCUS: (Deferential, broken) [Stability: 0.3] "And if the time never comes?"

Drusilla pauses at the threshold, her silhouette framed by vapor and morning light.

DRUSILLA: (Stoic, soft) [Stability: 0.9] "Then you will have lived longer than you deserved. Be grateful."

She disappears into the steam. Marcus stands alone, the tablet in his hand, the water dripping from somewhere deep within the baths—counting out time like a verdict yet to fall.

---

## SC15 — EXT. THE ROMAN FORUM - AFTERNOON

The afternoon sun bleaches the marble steps of the Basilica Aemilia, throwing harsh shadows across the milling crowds. The air tastes of dust and copper—election season, when even the walls have opinions. Marcus Licinius moves through the throng with his head down, clutching a wax tablet to his chest like armor.

He freezes.

On the Column of Maeniana, fresh paint still wet: MARCUS LICINIUS—SERPENT'S TONGUE. BEWARE THE ACCOUNTANT WHO COUNTS HIS FRIENDS LAST.

MARCUS: (Panicked, breathless) [Stability: 0.3] "No. No, no—this cannot—"

He spins. Another column. Another wall. The graffiti spreads like plague sores across the Forum's face—twelve messages, perhaps fifteen, all bearing his name.

A FISH VENDOR pauses at his stall, squinting at the nearest inscription.

FISH VENDOR: (Amused, loud) [Stability: 0.7] "Says here this Marcus fellow sold false tales about the banker Crassipes. Claims Crassipes was skimming from his own clients." He laughs. "Someone traced the lie back to its maker, eh?"

Marcus wipes his hands against his tunic, leaving damp streaks. His eyes dart toward the Rostra, toward the Temple of Saturn, toward every exit blocked by curious bodies.

A WOOL MERCHANT joins the vendor, arms crossed.

WOOL MERCHANT: (Contemptuous, pointed) [Stability: 0.6] "I know that name. Keeps the books for Caelus Varo." He spits. "If the servant lies, what does that say about the master's house?"

MARCUS: (Desperate, too loud) [Stability: 0.2] "These are falsehoods! Fabrications meant to—"

FISH VENDOR: (Interrupting, dismissive) [Stability: 0.7] "Fabrications? Like the ones you spread about Crassipes? One part in ten of the city knows your face now, friend. And none of them trust it."

Marcus backs away. The tablet slips from his fingers and cracks against the paving stones. He does not retrieve it. Around him, the crowd's murmur rises—his name passing from lip to lip, each utterance stripping another layer of protection.

MARCUS: (Hollow, to himself) [Stability: 0.3] "Crassipes's allies. They found me. They found—"

He looks up at the Capitoline Hill, where Varo's influence once seemed unassailable.

MARCUS: (Trembling, precise) [Stability: 0.3] "Eighty-seven transactions I have recorded for him. Eighty-seven opportunities to learn too much." He swallows. "And now I am worth nothing as a witness—who would believe a man the walls call traitor?"

The wool merchant laughs. The fish vendor returns to his scales. The Forum continues its business, indifferent to the small man unraveling at its center.

Marcus stands alone, graffiti surrounding him like an arena's walls.

MARCUS: (Quiet, broken) [Stability: 0.2] "He will hear of this before nightfall. And when Varo hears—"

He does not finish. He does not need to. The walls have already spoken for him.

---

## SC16 — INT. VARO'S STUDY - AFTERNOON

Watery light filters through the high windows, casting pale rectangles across ledgers stacked with the precision of a military formation. The room smells of ink, old parchment, and the faint metallic tang of coins recently counted. A bronze abacus sits on the desk, its beads arranged in a configuration that speaks of debts calculated to the last quadrans.

Gaius Crassipes stands before the window, his back to the door, fingers drumming a patient rhythm against a wax tablet. Two men wait near the doorway—Numerius, a thin-faced freedman who handles delicate acquisitions, and beside him a broader figure called Sextus, who carries a leather satchel heavy with documents.

CRASSIPES: (Satisfied, measured) [Stability: 0.8] "The Ostian properties. The warehouse shares. Even that pitiful vineyard in Campania."

He turns, and his smile carries the warmth of a winter sun—bright, but offering no heat.

CRASSIPES: (Amused, silken) [Stability: 0.8] "Our friend Marcus has been quite industrious, hiding his little treasures. One almost admires the effort."

Numerius steps forward, producing a scroll from his sleeve.

NUMERIUS: (Neutral, professional) [Stability: 0.7] "The grain merchant Calvus held three of the warehouse shares in trust. He was... amenable to discussion once we clarified his own outstanding obligations."

Crassipes laughs—too readily, the sound filling the study like spilled wine.

CRASSIPES: (Jovial, deliberate) [Stability: 0.7] "Amenable. I do appreciate a man who understands the poetry of leverage."

He crosses to the desk, touching Numerius's arm in that familiar gesture of false intimacy.

CRASSIPES: (Calculating, soft) [Stability: 0.8] "And the vineyard?"

SEXTUS: (Flat, reporting) [Stability: 0.7] "Purchased outright through a third party this morning. The previous holder believed he was selling to a Neapolitan merchant."

Crassipes lifts the abacus, slides a single bead across with his thumb. Then another. The soft clicking sounds like the tumblers of a lock falling into place.

CRASSIPES: (Contemplative, smooth) [Stability: 0.8] "Poor Marcus. He sought to build a raft from the wreckage of his master's ship. Now he discovers someone else owns the very planks."

He sets down the abacus and turns to face his men, his expression settling into something harder beneath the accommodating smile.

CRASSIPES: (Determined, double-edged) [Stability: 0.8] "Varo believes he holds Marcus by the throat. Fabius circles like a hungry dog. And neither understands that a man's loyalty flows not to whoever threatens loudest, but to whoever controls his bread."

He moves toward the door, pausing to adjust the folds of his toga with deliberate care.

CRASSIPES: (Quiet, final) [Stability: 0.9] "Send word to our desperate accountant. Tell him a friend wishes to discuss his future—and remind him that friends, unlike patrons, rarely demand blood."

The bronze abacus catches the afternoon light, its beads now arranged in a new configuration entirely.

---

## SC17 — INT. THE CROOKED CUP TAVERN - EVENING

Smoke from cheap tallow candles thickens the air, catching the dying light that bleeds through gaps in the shuttered windows. The tavern keeper—a man with fingers missing and questions never asked—has cleared the back corner as instructed. Two denarii for privacy. Three for silence.

Marcus Licinius sits with his back to the wall, a habit of men who count other people's coins. His wine sits untouched. His hands move across his tunic, wiping, wiping.

Drusilla enters without announcement. Her cloak is plain wool, beneath her station—deliberate anonymity. She takes the seat across from him, spine straight as a temple column, and waits.

The silence stretches. Marcus breaks first. He always does.

MARCUS: (Nervous, rushed) [Stability: 0.4] "I thank you for coming. I know the risk you take, meeting with a man in my... position."

Drusilla says nothing. Her eyes find his and hold.

MARCUS: (Calculating, desperate) [Stability: 0.3] "Varo's ledgers—I kept them. Every shipment. Every bribe. Forty-three officials. Nine senators. The weight of it would sink him, Domina."

His eyes dart to the door. To the window. Back to her unblinking gaze.

MARCUS: (Pleading) [Stability: 0.3] "You have influence with him. You could speak on my behalf. Make him see reason before—"

DRUSILLA: (Clinical, soft) [Stability: 0.8] "Before what, precisely?"

MARCUS: (Hardening, bitter) [Stability: 0.4] "Before I am forced to remember other things. Things perhaps... closer to your heart."

He wipes his palms again. Leans forward.

MARCUS: (Low, threatening) [Stability: 0.3] "Your children take their lessons at the house near the Temple of Vesta. Third watch, each morning. The tutor is old. The porter drinks. Such a long walk through narrow streets."

The air between them turns to iron.

Drusilla's posture does not change. Her breathing does not quicken. She regards him as a physician might regard an interesting wound.

DRUSILLA: (Ice, measured) [Stability: 0.9] "You have miscounted, Marcus Licinius."

MARCUS: (Confused) [Stability: 0.4] "I—what?"

DRUSILLA: (Diagnostic, final) [Stability: 0.9] "You have counted my children. You have counted Varo's enemies. You have not counted the men who would open your throat for the price of a meal—and I know all their names."

She rises. Her shadow falls across him like a blade.

DRUSILLA: (Quiet, absolute) [Stability: 0.9] "I came here to offer you my hand. You have chosen instead to show me the worm in your heart."

Marcus's face drains of color. His mouth opens, closes. The numbers have failed him.

DRUSILLA: (Cold, soft) [Stability: 0.9] "You wished to know consequences, accountant. You shall have a full reckoning."

She walks to the door, pauses, speaks without turning.

DRUSILLA: (Lethal, whispered) [Stability: 0.9] "I shall send flowers to your mother. She will need them before the next full moon."

The door closes behind her. Marcus sits alone with his untouched wine and his trembling hands, and understands at last that some debts cannot be tallied.

---

## SC18 — INT. VARO'S STUDY - NIGHT

A single oil lamp gutters on the desk, throwing long shadows across wax tablets stacked like tombstones. The room smells of old parchment and something sharper—the tang of ink mixed with something medicinal. Caelus Varo stands at the window, his back to the two men who wait in the doorway, their sandals scraping against the stone floor.

Varo does not turn. His fingers drum against the windowsill—a merchant's calculation, each tap a denarius counted.

VARO: (Flat, Clipped) [Stability: 0.8] "Close the door."

The taller of the two agents—a thick-necked Campanian with a scar bisecting his left eyebrow—pushes the oak shut. The latch falls with a sound like a trap springing.

Varo tugs at his short tunic, adjusting the hem where it has ridden up. Still he does not turn.

VARO: (Cold, Mathematical) [Stability: 0.8] "Quintus Fabius. You know his villa on the Caelian."

CAMPANIAN AGENT: (Cautious, Low) [Stability: 0.6] "We know it, Dominus."

VARO: (Impatient, Dismissive) [Stability: 0.7] "His wife leaves for her family's estates before dawn. The third watch. He will be alone save for two household slaves."

He turns now. The lamplight catches his face—unremarkable features arranged into something that might be boredom, might be appetite.

VARO: (Matter-of-fact, Profane) [Stability: 0.8] "Make it look like thieves. The usual shit—ransacked rooms, stolen silver. Let them find the body by morning."

The second agent, younger, shifts his weight. His jaw works.

YOUNGER AGENT: (Uneasy, Quiet) [Stability: 0.5] "The Senator has guards, Dominus. Two at least."

VARO: (Staccato, Cutting) [Stability: 0.8] "Three. The third drinks at a tavern near the Porta Capena until the stars turn. I have paid his tab for a month."

He moves to the desk. Picks up a small leather purse. Tosses it. The Campanian catches it without looking.

VARO: (Flat, Final) [Stability: 0.9] "Half now. The rest when I read the announcement in the Forum."

The agents exchange a glance. The Campanian tucks the purse beneath his cloak.

CAMPANIAN AGENT: (Grim, Professional) [Stability: 0.7] "It is well, Dominus."

They turn to leave. Varo's voice stops them at the door.

VARO: (Soft, Dangerous) [Stability: 0.9] "One more thing."

He sits, reaching for a stylus as though already moving on to the next matter of business.

VARO: (Cold, Almost Amused) [Stability: 0.8] "His ring. The one with the bull signet. Bring it to me. I want him to know, wherever the dead know anything, that I took everything."

The lamp flickers. The door opens and closes.

Varo begins to write, the scratch of stylus against wax the only sound—a man composing letters while murder walks the streets in his name.

---

## SC19 — INT. FABIUS HOUSE - ATRIUM - NIGHT

The oil lamp gutters, throwing restless shadows across the impluvium's still water. Quintus Fabius Maximus sits alone on the marble bench where his father once received clients, where his grandfather once planned campaigns. The wax tablets and scrolls spread before him catch the flame's trembling light—column after column of figures, names, dates. The evidence of his own ruin.

His toga has slipped from one shoulder. He does not adjust it.

QUINTUS: (Hollow, Barely audible) [Stability: 0.3] "Three generations. Three generations of service to the Republic, and it ends with... with this."

He traces a finger down one column. Ships that never sailed. Grain that never arrived. Yet somewhere, the gold moved. Always the gold moved.

The household is silent. Even the slaves have retreated to their quarters, sensing the storm that gathers in their master's stillness. Only old Philo, the freedman doorkeeper, remains at his post in the vestibule, too deaf now to hear his master's whispered reckonings.

QUINTUS: (Rising anger, Controlled) [Stability: 0.4] "Caelus Varo. You wove this web with patient hands, did you not? While I stood in the Forum defending the old ways, you were here—"

He stops. The next scroll bears his wife's seal.

His hands do not shake as he unrolls it. A Fabius does not shake. His father taught him that before the siege of Numantia took him. But his breath catches—one breath, two—as he reads what Drusilla's own hand has recorded.

QUINTUS: (Devastated, Whispered) [Stability: 0.2] "'The weight of it.' She used those very words. Our words."

He sets the scroll down with terrible care, as though it might shatter.

From somewhere in the house, a door closes. The sound of his wife's sandals on mosaic—the distinctive rhythm he has known for twenty years. She is awake. She is coming.

Quintus gathers the evidence. Not to hide it—no, that time has passed like water through his fingers. He gathers it because a man should face his destroyer with clear eyes and ordered thoughts.

He quotes softly, almost to himself:

QUINTUS: (Bitter, Resigned) [Stability: 0.4] "'Moribus antiquis res stat Romana virisque.' The Roman state stands on ancient customs and men. So wrote Ennius."

He looks toward the lararium, where the death masks of his ancestors watch from their niches, bronze eyes gleaming in the lamplight.

QUINTUS: (Cold, Steady) [Stability: 0.5] "But what stands when the customs rot from within the house itself?"

The footsteps grow closer. He does not turn.

QUINTUS: (Quiet, Dangerous) [Stability: 0.6] "Come then, wife. Let us speak of loyalty—and of the price Varo paid for yours."

---

## SC20 — EXT. THE ROMAN FORUM / INT. VARO'S WAREHOUSE / INT. FABIUS VILLA - NIGHT

Torchlight fractures across the Forum's wet stones. The temples loom like judges. Somewhere, a dog howls at nothing.

---

**THE FORUM**

Marcus Licinius presses himself against the Column of Phocas, his breath visible in the cold. His hands move compulsively across his tunic, wiping, wiping. A shadow detaches from the Temple of Saturn.

MARCUS: (Terrified, Stammering) [Stability: 0.3] "I counted every denarius. Every shipment. The ledgers are clean—I swear by my father's shade—"

The ASSASSIN steps into the torchlight. Young. Provincial accent. A blade that catches no reflection.

ASSASSIN: (Cold, Professional) [Stability: 0.8] "The patron sends his regards."

Marcus's eyes dart to the exits. The Basilica Aemilia—too far. The Rostra—exposed.

MARCUS: (Desperate, Rapid) [Stability: 0.2] "Wait—wait—I know where the Greek documents are hidden! Varo's contingency, the one even she doesn't know about—"

---

**VARO'S WAREHOUSE**

Caelus Varo stands amid amphorae, checking the moon's position through a crack in the timber roof. A DOCK FOREMAN waits, shifting weight.

CAELUS: (Impatient, Clipped) [Stability: 0.7] "The shipment from Ostia. It arrived at the third watch?"

DOCK FOREMAN: (Nervous, Deferential) [Stability: 0.5] "Aye, Dominus. But the seals—"

CAELUS: (Sharp, Cutting) [Stability: 0.6] "I did not ask about seals. I asked about arrival."

He tugs at his short tunic. His jaw works.

CAELUS: (Calculating, Quiet) [Stability: 0.7] "Marcus should have sent word by now. The accountant is never late. Numbers are his god."

---

**FABIUS VILLA**

Quintus Fabius Maximus adjusts his toga fold before the household shrine. The flames gutter. Wax drips like old blood.

QUINTUS: (Moralizing, Grave) [Stability: 0.8] "As Ennius wrote: 'The Roman state stands on ancient customs and men.' Tonight, we remind them what customs mean."

His wife DRUSILLA enters, her face unreadable.

DRUSILLA: (Measured, Probing) [Stability: 0.6] "You sent the message?"

QUINTUS: (Defensive, Formal) [Stability: 0.7] "The ancestors watch and judge. I merely... aligned their will with opportunity."

He refuses to look at the small purse on the altar table. Gold glints within.

---

**THE FORUM**

The assassin advances. Marcus stumbles backward, palms raised.

MARCUS: (Pleading, Breaking) [Stability: 0.2] "I can give you Varo! Everything he's done—the bribes, the murders, the Senator's wife—"

ASSASSIN: (Flat, Final) [Stability: 0.9] "Who do you think paid me?"

The blade rises.

Marcus opens his mouth—

---

**FREEZE.**

Three locations. Three breaths held.

In the warehouse, Varo's hand stops mid-reach for a wine cup.

In the villa, Drusilla's fingers brush the purse, and Quintus pretends not to see.

In the Forum, Marcus's scream begins—

—and the blade descends.

**BLACKOUT.**

*The dead keep better ledgers than the living.*
